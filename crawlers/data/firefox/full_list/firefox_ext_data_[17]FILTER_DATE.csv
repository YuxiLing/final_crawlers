Especially trying to log into your account. Metamask recommends that you log out of your wallet when your not using it which is good advice as you don't want to tell everyone how much you have. However, it virtually impossible to log back into your account with a simple cut and paste of your 12 secret words and passwords. Let me explain...First you copy your 12 secret words to paste into the box. However, as soon as you click anywhere else to paste your password, the metamask window disappears. When you open it again, it's asking for the 12 secret words again. So, your only option is to paste in either the secret words or your password, not both. One of them has to be done manually to keep the window open. Another frustration I had was when I recovered my wallet after it logs me out is after I had pasted in my 12 words, it asks me to create a new password. Now this is supposed to be a strong, secure password and I like to use at least 12 digits. So I create a new password but as I type it in, all I am seeing is the common security dots so I can't see what I'm typing. This means I can't type it twice like it asks and I can't copy and paste it anywhere. The fact that the Metamask window reverts back to the start whenever I click away from it and have to open it again makes it almost impossible to use conveniently using cut and paste.One more issue I have with Metamask is, whenever I close my browser, my settings delete history and cache. This means I have to recover my wallet every time I open my browser. It also means I lose all of the account names and have to enter them again.This is a great app but the user interface is a nightmare and needs to be sorted. Metamask NEEDS to be able to save your settings even if you clear your cache.I'm giving Metamask a 2 star rating only because it does work once you work out how to enter your information without the ability to cut and paste"", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'very well', 'Defacto standard dapp utility.

I wish all companies had the same integrity. My only concern is how small the userbase seems to be (solely judging by the downloads here in Firefox extensions). Myki deserves hundreds of thousands of users, if not millions! I hope that I don't one day lose the wonderful functionality of Myki due to their overly reasonable monetization and small userbase. If it ever came to that, I would happily pay a monthly subscription akin to the popular note-taking app Bear, which is $1.99/mo.

Such absolutism (all-or-nothing think) is rarely useful to anyone. So, first, throw out all of the 1's and 5's and dig deeper into the reviews that have actual thoughtful analysis of the product. In this particular experience, the Capital One add-on, Eno, is wonderfully useful... when it works. For me, a frequent online shopper, it provides two things I value highly: convenience and security. I love having it available at shopping sites, with all the info I need to complete the purchase. I don't have to look up my card info and manually fill it in. Very nice. Sadly, some updates to Firefox and a few sites' code break the add-on. But I've found this to be true of many of the add-ons I use. Anytime an app or an operating system pushes out an update, it's not uncommon for software that interacts with it to break or have issues. So, this is not a particular sin of this add-on. It applies to many add-ons.Most importantly, I love Eno and the feature from Capital One to use a virtual number. The add-on just makes it easier to use. One can still interact with the Capital One website to manage their virtual numbers. Due, once again to occasional breaks from browser updates or particular sites, I have had to get creative when using the feature. This can be frustrating. It's not perfect, but overall, it works more than it doesn't, and the ability to generate a one-time use number is invaluable when it comes to online security. Keep in mind, the virtual number feature is very flexible. You can keep using the number for that particular site, but lock it, so it's only usable when you allow it, you can just delete it, or leave it unlocked for one particular merchant only (e.g. for a subscription).If you're not using a virtual number, you are asking to be hacked.

But after 2 months, I have mostly changed my mind.  I\'m leaving my old review below, but here is a new perspective and 3 more stars, for 4 stars total.I had no trouble installing this or using it many many times afterwards.  It has worked, as far as I can tell, exactly as CapitalOne wants it to work. It was different from my Bank of America Shop Safe, so at first I hated it.  But I have found a way to use it well.  It has a drawback I will describe, but in some ways its also better. Here is how I use it.1. Keep the extension disabled, except when you need a new virtual credit card number.  That way it cannot spy on you at every website you go to.  When you need one, enable it, get the virtual card number and record it in your password vault.  Disable the extension.  The only problem here is that you must have a website open to ""attach"" the virtual number to.  I have been able to occasionally get a number that is not yet attached to a site, but I cannot repeat it.  When I can, I will add that info here.  But you are not actually limited to that website.  You can even use the number over the phone.  It appears that the number is permanently attached to the first credit processor that uses it, like ShopSafe was.  This is very useful, because giving number over the phone to a human is much more dangerous than typing it into a computer.  (CapitalOne - Please support getting numbers that are independent of a website!!  Thanks!)Your charge goes pending at first, so you cannot delete virtual card right away.  But every time you get a new one, check for old ones that you can delete.  This was my substitute for being able to define an expiration date in ShopSafe.  Its not automatic, and you cannot set a maximum charge amount, but it seems good enough.  That said, I decided I did not actually have to delete them every time.  As long as I knew who I gave it to, if I got any bogus charges, I would know where the problem was.  And since the number is probably locked to the first card processor that uses it, it is unlikely that it could be used by anyone who stole it in an IT breach from a company where I used it.  I could probably have done this with ShopSafe too, but didnt realize it.  Now I feel comfortable using it for recurring charges also.So...I am pretty happy right now.  If I stopped being able to use a number over the phone, I would probably go looking for another credit card to replace this.  Using it over the phone is not officially supported and this is the main reason I only have it 4 stars.  The other reason is that I have to enable and disable it every time I use it.  But thats not too onerous.  Thanks Capital One!  Sorry for the misunderstanding at first....*********** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***********If you are looking for a ShopSafe replacement (recently cancelled by Bank of America) Eno based virtual credit card numbers from a CapitalOne card are not for you.  These virtual credit card numbers do not give you the same protections from online fraud and do not work the way you would expect.  First, you must use this app to create and manage virtual numbers.  There is no website that I can find.  This app is ""always on"" and watching your browsing activity to look for a site it thinks you might want a virtual credit card number for.  So your browsing activity is no longer private.  You cannot create a virtual card number until the app sees you on such a site.  I was able to activate it on a dummy site, but then it links that URL to the credit card number.   It set the expiration date of the virtual credit card 5 years into the future, oddly, past the expiration date for my real Capital One credit card.  You cannot set a virtual number to expire after a certain number of months, like you could for ShopSafe numbers.  Likewise, you cannot set a maximum charge amount for a virtual number, so anyone who gets this can charge as much as they like.  So Eno virtual credit card numbers don\'t protect you from an unscrupulous online vendor, like ShopSafe did.  In fact, if you read the Terms and Conditions, you will see that the virtual number may not even be locked to a specific merchant, like ShopSafe was.  They appear to be testing this, but ""...a VC# you create for use Merchant A should work at Merchant A, but may or may not work at Merchant B.""  So in my opinion, this does not really protect me very much.  In fact, since there are no limits on the merchants and you cannot limit the maximum amount nor set a short expiration date, it may make you more vulnerable to fraud.  If someone steals a virtual number from a company you gave it to, they can use it just as if they stole a card from your wallet.  The only reasonable thing you can really do is delete the virtual number, but that assumes you know it was stolen.  We usually dont find out about that until long long after it happens. In fairness, unlike other reviews, I will say that I had no problems using my phone number to validate (via text messages) and get this set up.  Setup worked just fine.I am thinking carefully, because I really want a ShopSafe alternative, but this credit card will probably go back.', 'I\'m a long-time Capital One Banking customer.  After BofA discontinued their virtual credit card numbers (""ShopSafe"") I opened a Capital One Savor One card account for the SOLE PURPOSE OF USING VIRTUAL NUMBERS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING.  After receiving the card and attempting to set up Eno I was frustrated by the inability to log into my account / verify my account, which requires the ability to receive an SMS text.  I do not have a mobile phone, and the Google Voice account that I have isn\'t ""acceptable"" to the Eno verification process.  Every other financial account or service that I have (and there are almost a dozen of them, not including the IRS..) allows me to verify either by a phone call, a hard-copy mailed PIN, or an email sent to the address on file.  It appears that Capital One doesn\'t care much about their customer\'s needs or requirements, since the only option being provided for Eno verification is the SMS/text of an identifier.  After an hour with Tech Support and an escalation to a supervisor I\'ve been told ""this is the way it is"".  So non-mobile phone users are automatically excluded as Eno users.  That is blind thinking.Since I can\'t use Eno I\'ve decided to open a competitor\'s card account (the one remaining provider of virtual card numbers), and while I\'m at it I may as well move my banking accounts as well.  I already have too many accounts at different institutions.If this isn\'t fixed in 90 days I\'ll have no need for the Savor One card.  After I\'ve earned the $150 spiff that I get for the new card I\'ll be closing that account.  Thanks Capital One for the $150 and for the memories.', ""ENO works sometimes and it doesn't sometimes.

Eventually I ""hit the max"" and have to wait for the next day to try again (and call in again).

Obviously, there is going to be strong opinions when it comes to the opinion pieces.  They address this in their media overview. The authors behind this plugin are in a difficult situation, and everyone will have some news source they like that they believe it is trustable.  In that case, I\'m seeing a lot of the negative reviews shooting the messenger, which is the NewsGuard team. I am very appreciative of the work that the team behind this plugin are doing.  I hope they continue down the path of giving details information in the form of ownership, integrity, and intention of the news sources we trust and be able to vouch for news sources we\'re not familiar with and put the red-flag up when bad actors are in the mix. If you find yourself hating the results of this plugin, maybe you should be re-thinking the sources of information you trust. The problem isn\'t the plugin!  Facts are a fickle thing, and that\'s what the group behind this plugin appear to be doing a good job giving us.  To see the truth, and to then get angry about it and give the plugin a 1-star rating is intellectually dishonest and unfair to the authors.

It should be noted though that the plugin does not claim, nor could it reasonably claim to verifiy any news source as 100% reliable.One further observation, almost every negative review comes from someone who tried to use this to verify their pre-existing assumptions about a news source, and dismisses the validity of the plugin because it does not confirm their existing presumptions - curiously enough the very target audience most biased sources prefer, imagine that.', '', '', '', 'There is no perfect solution to fake news other than taking personal resposibility for the time and effort requird to verify information.  This plugin is simply a tool which can give an indication to how trustworthy a source is likely to be.  There are a lot of lazy 1-star reviews from people angry that their most loved or most hated news outlet isn\'t rated how they want it to be.  That is missing the point.  I personally disagree with just about everything that is published by the British Tabloid ""The Daily Mail"" - but it gets a green rating overall and gets 6 out of 9 greens.  half of these green ratings are for transparency - for all it\'s nasty content the mail doesn\'t hide what it is - it is the rightwing mouthpiece of Viscount Rothermere, a member of the British aristocracy.  Whilst the reporting in the daily mail is heavily biased, this is not what newsguard claims to rate.Furthermore - rather than criticise newsguard for changing the rating for the daily mail from red to green (as they recently did), I admire their openness to change.  The mail previously rated less well for openness, probably because when contacted by newsguard originally they weren\'t forthcoming with the information requested, and deservedly got rated badly for openness.  Once the mail made this information available newsguard rightly changed their rating.I think the most helpful review below is unsurprisingly the most considered one, by concentricbrainwaves.  I also agree that having an amber rating would be helpful, and in the case of the daily mail, would probably be appropriate.  This is really my only negative - the overall rating is not as useful as it should be and to get genuinely useful ratings you will need to view the details 9-point breakdown.  To make the overall rating more useful it should only be possible to get green overall with a higher score than 6/9 - probably 8/9', 'Diese App ist nicht nur überflüssig, sondern gefährlich.Überflüssig, weil man dann gelcih auf selbst denken und Internet verzichten kann und den Fernseher mit ZDF oder WDR einschalten kann.Gefährlich ist es, weil damit die ohnehin schon schlimmen Versuche, eine ideologische Einheitsmeinung durchzusetzen, verstärkt werden (was wohl auch das Ziel ist). Demokratie, Meinungsfreiheit, Kritik an Eliten etc. soll weitgehend unterbunden, Alternativen aus dem Gesichtskreis verbannt werden.Ein Beweis ist, dass Mainstreammedien natürlich als korrekt bewertet werden, selbst wenn krasse und offensichtliche Fake News verbreitet werden.', ""This plugin looks great! On the other hand, I'm probably not in the target audience, because I've so far been surprised by exactly none of its rankings. I really appreciate the fact that NewsGuard is taking this on, and I'm hoping that more people start using it.EDIT: I've read a whole bunch of the one-star reviews, and most of them seem to be angry, but most of them are angry about green labels for sites that display bias. I think it's important to note that bias is almost entirely irrelevant to the goal of NewsGuard. NewsGuard doesn't tell you whether sites are biased, just whether they're telling you the truth. This is why Fox news and CNN both get green labels: you may not agree with which stories they choose to carry, but they both generally adhere to accepted standards of journalism: tell the truth, and admit it when you get something wrong."", ""I checked many sites with this and it is very bias and untruthful.  Perfect example they give Buzzfeed perfect green checks across the boar, Buzzfeed is a joke but they rate it perfect. Also CNN has perfect green across the board. CNN has had some miss steps lately should not be perfect green. Fox news got a few red x's and ok but CNN should be about equal to that as they are as far left as fox news is right."", 'Ranks Daily Mail as a reputable source. Useless.', 'This extension gets four stars, for now.Most of this accolade is for the idea and some of it is an encouragement to further development into a truly impartial algorithmic guide (insofar as this is possible).I think the red-and-green categorisations are a little too black-and-white and likely to be controversial (because, increasingly, almost nobody among the general population reads ""the news"" without some acquired bias). Perhaps *White* should mean ""so far as can be detected this site is trying to get it right"" and *Amber* should mean ""there is some doubt about the veracity of some items on this site"" with, in both cases, a link to more detail. A third colour (Blue?) would be useful to indicate news aggregators with a legend along the lines of ""This is a news aggregation site. Please check source articles on the originating sites"".Finally, it is disappointing that a particular print-and-online ""news"" publication recently had it\'s rating changed from ""Red"" to ""Green"" without changing its editorial stance in any way. To my mind ""Red"" was thoroughly deserved because the publication presents opinion as if it were fact and habitually spins news to such a degree that it winds up seeming to mean the opposite of the original facts. Others will disagree with me on that assessment but independently verifiable ""facts"" are ""the news"" which the reader should interpret whereas ""opinion"" is someone else\'s (often malicious and politically motivated) interpretation. When opinion is dressed up as the news it is *fake news*; when a fact is twisted it becomes a lie.  If, under the colour scheme suggested above, the publication in question were to be marked ""amber"" (with straight-forward explanation) - No Red, No Green, - NewsGuard\'s rating would be less likely to seem biased, even to some of the One-Star Generals who, in this comment space, have denigrated this nascent attempt to differentiate information from disinformation.', 'This widget requires massive amounts of work. Classifying news sources as ""outright 100% true"" and ""outright 100% false"" with their green/red mark label system is not the right way to do things.They have very complete ""Nutrition Labels"" which allow for more complex ways to classify sites, so why don\'t they use them?This can work but not for the time being. I highly discourage anyone from trying to get source guidance out of this widget in it\'s current state.Based on the forementioned Nutrition Labels, they clearly have plenty of information on the sites they rate. All they have to do is use them more openly and make them simpler for a user to understand, instead of just putting them side to side and saying ""This is great"", ""This is terrible"".', '', 'Thank you for creating this add-on.

These judgements have nothing to do with political orientation, but are based on general good practice in journalism (proper citation of sources, conflicts of interest and source of money made by website).There criteria can be very helpful in identifying fake or misleading news as well as propaganda.

Turns out the page was in separate container than the last time I had allowed those permissions. The permissions are *CONTAINER SPECIFIC*. I hadn't really properly put Multi-User Container add-on really to good use!Now I don't lose permissions. I can have certain (all possible to keep things working) Google servers blocked on default - same with any FaceBook servers. In fact, FaceBook servers are only allowed on FaceBook container. And if a site that does not belong to YouTube container, but needs to show video from YouTube, I either temporarily allow the servers, or I move the site into YouTube container; which needs a good good reason if it's not a Google's YouTube services. OR, I'll add another container for pages that don't need all the YouTube and Google servers allowed, but need to have just those allowed that let the videos roll; and move that site there. This is in fact incredibly great way to work, although I still miss the Legacy version - I will soon try changing to a fork that has all the modern support of FF, and support for legacy add-on's. Then I can use the original, and get the massive power of ABE, but will the Legacy code be updated to have same support for multiple containers? That I would love, best of both worlds.I even have a container for MyWOT.com, which everyone should know already is a scam itself, but the user reviews are real - and great. So that container shouldn't be able to reach any info not loaded while in that very container. And only MyWOT.com ever is.P.S.

All issues have been verified by disabling NoScript: without it no issues occur, with it enabled all occur, so it is the sole cause.First, after a while, as others have reported, Firefox just stops working and will show nothing.

Where is it trying to import scripts from?The problem, reported on the NoScript forum that pages on local disks are broken since 10.1.9.2 on Firefox 61.0.2 remains. The scripts (used to) run but incorrectly also showed the content of < noscript >. A moderator proved this with a use case but the report has now been deleted. In Firefox 62.0, it is now worse. The page may load once (incorrectly) if you are lucky, then if you reload it stops (previous point). There is no facility in the current UI to specify permission for local pages (I think there was before the big change to the Firefox api)Somewhere, probably in 10.1.9.2, the user list of allowed and blocked sites has been corrupted. 10.1.9.4 was supposed to fix this and recover the situation but hasn't [on the first or second runs].As you just seem to delete some issues reported on your forums, please don't ask me to post there.

The new interface is Terrible to put it mildly. Its over \'simplification\' and design has produced a bewildering experience that makes ones head ache in a state of near vertigo when first used. Just to add insult to injury, as previously stated, you will probably have repeat the process when the settings are forgotten.No script has always been annoying when visiting a site for the first time. Identifying the minimum scripts allowed for site functionality whilst blocking the rest, was a tedious process but it was offset by the fact it only had to be done once. The result was a huge dividend of security, privacy, speed of page load, reduced memory usage and increased stability to the browser as a whole from avoiding execution of unnecessary and in many cases poorly written, bloated code.In short the new NoScript is a horrible disappointment, in stark contrast to the wonderful browsing experience of Firefox 57""At that time I felt the review was completely justified.But, there is hope!The UI is improving and in some ways, superior to the old which I think we all have to agree was a bit clumsy.I understand now the \'forgetting\' of settings directly attributable to the API changes in Quantum and Mozillas role in it and the unfair but understandable scorn from users like myself who have become accustomed to features being removed and UI changes from likes of Microsoft and others in the name of \'progress\' and our willingness to unload both barrels as a result.I persisted with noscript, temporally allowing just about everything, relying on Sandboxie protection.It improves with every update to my everlasting gratitude and I cannot wait for the day I rate it 5 stars!THANK YOU to the developer(s) for all of your hard work and persistence in the face of mounting criticism from people like myself.No Script is in my opinion a vital extension for security, privacy, stability, user control and the enrichment of the browsing experience...', '', '', ""Thank you for the interface changes!

Overall, I think the current version of NS is quite smooth to use. The current UI is understandable but it is still far from perfect. However, I think it is worth to trade some convenience for better security.I have the following suggestions for NS. Some of them were suggested before indeed.1. Include a button to allow all scripts globally in the main UI. Sometimes when we do something really important, such as making a payment online, we would like to allow all scripts globally and temporarily. Having the button in the main UI would save us a few seconds each time. In contrast, the button ""Temporarily allow all this page"" has very little practical use in my opinion.2. As some other users pointed out, get rid of the ""slider"" thing. It takes up too much space so it makes the list of scripts unreadable. It also makes the position of the buttons not consistent.3. The list of scripts can be sorted in a better way. List the blocked scripted at the top and the allowed scripts at the bottom.Overall, I think the current version of NS is much better than 2 months ago and it does what it is supposed to do now. NS seems to be the only firefox addon which provide protection beyond blocking javascripts. It worth 4 or 5 stars in my opinion.

Simpler might be less safer, but if the alternative is not using it at all, it\'s still better. Way better.- get rid of the slider. It looks mhm good(?), but its not recognizable as one.- there is way to much clickable stuff, one does not get what is a button, what a link and whatnot...- make it simpler: hide everything exept: domain name, status icon and -depending on the status- two buttons for each entry.- clear design, dont change font size and font color at any time- No xss-popups. In fact, never, ever use popups.Instead:- a simple list of domains like before, each with a status icon in front of it: your blue ""S"", for allowed, same with a little clock for temporarily allowd,  red crossed ""S"" for disallowed - depending on the current status of an entry, two buttons: - if currently allowed:  ""disallow"" and ""temp. disallow"" - if currently disallowed:  ""allow"" and ""temp. allow""- these buttons need to be different than the status icon. I would use red X and green hook/check, each with and without a little clock.- dont make anything but the buttons clickable! not the text, not the status icon. Thats it. You can add a (clearly seperated from the other buttons, clearly different graphic) button behind each list entry to hide all the detailed settings, for the expert.

Under the old version, it only gave me an XSS warning for a certain few websites which I could then do an unsafe reload.

Thank you, Giorgio for that.I do blame Mozilla somewhat for switching to a substandard extension API and not having certain vital API features available to developers to test until very late (and some not even yet existing). I realise there were some reasons to make the change, but they should have considered the effect on the existing users and developers and tried to mitigate it somehow.While I agree that expressing such anger in obscene words is inappropriate, it is appropriate to give an honest review and rating. My rating expresses what I currently think about this addon and is by no means an emotional reaction to change.

Maybe the developer could implement very quickly a joker system allowing to enter domains like :*.akamai.net*.hd.akamai.netIn first case we allow every subdomain of akamai.netIn the second case we limit to every subdomain of hd.akamai.net2) No synchornization optionIdeally, NoScript should store the users data in cloud through the Firefox account as ScripSafe does in the Google Account.But maybe it is not possible according to the Firefox account policy, so the workaround should be to be able to synchronize data to/from a local path on the computer.One just have to create this path in a OneDrive or Google Drive synchronized directory...and this should be done.I have several computer, each computer has several users session, this is just annoying to set up NosSript for each repeating always the same process. And when I set up a new computer, I must restart from the beginning.With ScripSafe, this is very easy... the extension automatically download and upload to Google Accounts (one must activate such option).If ScripSafe is ever ported to Firefox with the same functionalities, I drop NoScript3) Slow GUIAs today, the NoScript GUI is I N C R E D I B L Y slow.As a comparison ScripSafe is incredibly fast to display the distant hosts listBut this version is a kind of quick done dirty version, let\'s be patient, this will be probably fixed in the future, but developer must know that the situation is as today not acceptable. I also suspect that NoScript 10  slows down the browser4) Inefficient filtering mechanismIn the former XUL extension, the filtering engine of NoScript was crappy as it was oftenly forgetting a lot of distant host.So one needed sometimes to switch to ""allow all scripts"" to see these hosts, and go back to ""forbide all scripts"", and so we could set rules for theses invisible hosts.As compared, ScripSafe was far better as there was not such issues.Finally....

How am I supposed to test a website? Giving it permanent permissions and later revoking them again is not a very effective way.There are still a lot of things to be done.

Temporary exceptions, selective and site-wide, were one of my most-used features of NoScript, and they\'re not in yet. Also, the options screen is severely lacking, a lot of the behaviour I used to customise can\'t be changed right now. I assume that all of these things are still possible, and just haven\'t been implemented yet.

Also no arbitrary small data limits either. Windscribe used to be pretty good but has deteriorated over time.update 12/17/20: THe high star ratings this vpn gets are testament NOT to it\'s quality but to the very poor performance of all ""free"" vpns. When it works, it works reasonably well, but most of the time it\'s just FLAKY. Cannot connect because it cannot find the open browser tab even when the browser is connected to a site. Very few ""free proxies"" They make you hunt for them and their GUI is a PITA to use, slow and cumbersome. Today their servers lost my login info and I had to relogin cuz they could not recognize that I was a long time user. I wonder if ANY of these ""FREE"" vpns will ever amount to anything.

Connects sometimes automatically on browser open which is good. The user interface could be made more user friendly and easier to use. Takes too much time to navigate to what you want. mini popups to explain the buttons are in order.update: 11-18-20: really deteriorated, extremely slow both to connect and in data transfer. Very few free proxies, takes forever to find one. Diconnects on ""autopilot"" so even they cannot find a working proxy. Obvious they do not want free users. Had trouble connecting to make this review maybe being blocked? Another lame ""free"" proxy. BS.Better than most, BUT same as all the others-will not allow access to any website that uses software to ID proxies. None of the free vpns do this and most of the paid ones do not either. You need residential proxies for that and they cannot afford to offer that for free. So if a webpage is blocking proxies you\'re SOL-u will not get in. Same for sites like netflix. SO SLOW ACROSS SEVERAL PROXIES THAT IS IT ALMOST UNUSABLE. in firefox but kudos that they kept my login credentials even after over a year not using-shows they are professional.

Be very careful and install at your own risk.  By the third day, I have Re-installed Fedora 30 and Re-formatted the partitions and only installed   mozilla-noscript   from the Fedora repository and only installed   HTTPS Everywhere   from the Firefox add-ons.By the third day of testing, fiddling and using this add-on, I had lost the trust and confidence for this add-on.  My last Fedora 30 was only installed a week ago with only the default packages.  I had only NoScript and HTTPS Everywhere in Firefox that I had used for years.  Windscribe was the only extra add-on.With Windscribe:1)  By the third day, I had to enter the url at least 3 times before it start loading.  Websites kept reloading.  It was slow with this add-on ON and its was not useable.  I had to set it to OFF for Firefox to work.2)  ifconfig   showed that about 30 MiB, the total of all the   tun   and   WiFi   Tx and Rx traffic, whereas the Windscribe counter showed more than 100 MiB used.  There was no download or Video for the three days.  2.5 GiB consumed for just Text and some images in the last three days!  That is not possible.Can someone out there check what is actually going on using network tools like Wireshark, etc.?Ok.  I will do it on my own using OpenVPN and Cisco IPsec.Firefox should invest the resources to review all add-ons for all updates before allowing them to ride on its Browser as it could break its useability and much worse, plant sinister and malicious codes in its add-on.THE INTERNET IS FULL OF SECURITY FLAWS.  IT IS UP TO ALL OF US TO PUT IN THE HEART AND SOUL TO MAKE IT GOOD INSTEAD OF EVIL.  THEN THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE WORLD IS BAD FOR ANYONE.--------2 days ago reviewWow, Windscribe is really some Security and Privacy Services.  Using   sudo yum install windscribe-cli   from   /etc/yum.repos.d/windscribe.repo   was seamless.  windscribe viewlog show the line OpenVPN 2.4.7 x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu which is a native TRUE VPN which is, my desktop is connected direct to a France exit point through a VPN tunnel which is, all my desktop traffic is encrypted between any location to the exit point in France, like my actual location is in Malaysia, but my virtual location is in France.  If I use  wget  in Fedora 30, all my data traffic will go through the encrypted VPN tunnel.  I set my Firefox virtual location as Switzerland which is then a Double Hop, which is an improvement as all the Firefox traffic is encrypted to the France exit point and then the encrypted traffic is redirected to the exit point in Switzerland.  The Double Hop speed is slower, but acceptable.  Again, many thanks to the Windscibe Canadian team for producing this needed high quality internet package for the World.One good feature is that the   windscribe-cli   reconnect to the last VPN exit point at every Fedora 30 shutdown and boot up cycle.  It remember the setup parameters and connect exactly every time.  Similarly, Firefox also reconnect to the last VPN exit point in every Close and Start cycle.  In one VPN add-on that I tried, it requires me to login every time when I Start Firefox to get their VPN service.  I remove the VPN add-on immediately and add-on Windscribe.  That was when I discovered Windscribe yesterday.  After a day or so, I found that Windscribe has all that I want in a VPN service exactly and more!  It comes with Privacy on top of Security.  Is save me a lot of trouble to search and do it myself to get only 10% at most what Windscribe already has.sudo dnf update   will automatically update what is new in the windscribe.repo   .   It is best that Windscribe put the windscribe packages in the Fedora repository as an open source.  This would gain the trust and confidence of all Fedora users to install the Windscribe packages as any one can look into them for improvements and check for malicious code.   NoScript has done it.     sudo dnf install mozilla-noscript   will install from the Fedora repository since the much earlier Fedora versions.  There is no need to include the extension  NoScript  from Add-ons  .  dnf  will automatically install   NoScript  from the Fedora repository and embed   NoScript  into Firefox.   sudo dnf update will automatically update any new changes in   NoScript  onto Firefox. Again, it is good that    dnf install windscribe-cli   will do all the work from the Fedora repository as only the Windscribe development team know the best to give users the seamless process.  If Windscribe do have such a plan, please investigate the negatives in doing so.  Like, many people can break the   windscribe-cli   if too many people are involved.  Perhaps, there should be an approval process such that any new changes in the Fedora repository must be reviewed and check by the Windscribe developer before any update, big or small, can be updated in the Fedora repository.If only the Windscribe client is running in Firefox, the WiFi icon  is normal on the Fedora 30.  If both the   windscribe-cli  is running in Fedora 30   and the Windscribe add-on is running in Firefox, the WiFi icon becomes a ? (question mark).  It is imperative that the WiFi icon on the desktop screen is back to normal and add with a new 'Key' icon on the desktop whenever the  windscribe-cli   is running in Fedora 30 as describe below.  The colour of the Windscribe icon in Firefox will show the browser client status.Test 1)Power down Router only and then power Router up.Test 2)Main power supply down.  Router is down, but the Laptop is running on battery power.In both Test 1 and Test 2, after desktop connection established, Firefox VPN reconnect again.However, the Laptop desktop VPN tunnel remains disconnected.  Users must run 'windscribe connect FR' to establish a VPN tunnel to a France exit point.It is imperative that a Fedora 30 desktop must have a Windscribe security icon, like a 'Key Symbol' at the top right corner of the desktop screen to tell users that the Desktop is either connected or disconnected to a VPN exit point.  Cisco IPsec-based VPN and SecurityKiss OpenVPN both have the 'Key Symbol' on the Fedora desktop screen whenever the VPN tunnel is connected.It is desirable to have the Desktop automatically re-connected to the last VPN exit point as soon as the Desktop establish connection to the Home Router, very much like Firefox automatically reconnect to the  browser last VPN exit point perpetually,  as users may forget to reconnect the Desktop.For both Test 1 an Test 2, Firefox could connect to a new exit point and not the previous exit point.  It is desirable that Firefox remember the last connected exit point and establish all new connections as such in manual mode.The above three inclusions will improve the VPN connectivity by a mile.--------3 days ago reviewDo as described as a VPN like my IP address is one in Germany when I selected the virtual location as Germany.  Although I did not checked using tools for the extra features like ad blocking, etc., I trust that Windscribe state it as it is.Another plus is that Windscribe did not guide, force, misled or use sinister ploy in getting users to do unnecessary or unwanted upgrade.So far my experience with Windscribe is satisfactory and smooth.  Hopefully this add-on will keep on improving and will not degrade in the future.  Then Windscribe will always have a place in my Firefox in every of my new Fedora about every six months.

It does a bunch of stuff. I love Windscribe and think it's a great option for a light-use VPN.That being said, it is just better to get the desktop version of the app instead. The only way I would justify choosing the extension over the desktop app would be if you were using a portable version of Firefox. Otherwise, get their desktop application.Secondly, I was having an issue where Firefox was starting up and then not loading my home page (www.google.com). At first I blamed it on uBlock, but then I did some debugging and found that this extension blocks the first page from loading when Firefox starts. My guess is it has something to do with either the extension refusing to initially load the page, or if Firefox doesn't want to load a page on startup until all extensions are loaded. Either way, I'd rather remove the extension than use a different browser. :(Edit: After reading further reviews, it has been made clear by Windscribe that they have only put priority on the Chrome extension and have not been updating this problem despite its being reported on their subreddit.Edit 7/7/19: While I'm not acquainted with the add-ons rollout system, I feel that three months does not qualify as soon.

If that happens 1 click on a button and not even 1 to 2 seconds later i can resume with what ever i was doing.  I basically do not use this application that much so the amount of free Gigs i get per month are well enough for me.  Most VPNs ask a lot of money, give you free but very limited use (like 1 IP), and often those servers are as SLOW A F..  as basically everyone that is using that application is using that 1 free IP address.  Not with Windscribe !!  Every IP i connect to is almost instantly connected and there is barely NO noticeable difference in my internet responsiveness.

This is my normal connection speed without Windscribe on and pinging the closest server to me. http://prntscr.com/n000byNow lets put this to the test with Windscribe  on again pinging the closest server to me. http://prntscr.com/n0021a Now i would not recommend using a WS server that is on the other side of the world for gaming as you will see my ping is high and my upload speed is low.. I had a small loss of around 4 to 7 Mbps on download speed. I actually wanted to do 1 more test that to the same server as before but with a relay via France with WS.   Damn speed tester failed twice due to a firewall error.  ? Not the problem of WS but the speed tester. Ill stop it here as i am flying through my WS Gigs like a stoned hippy xD   But overall i am very very satisfied with the amount of data you get monthly from WS for free and also the amount of quality.  I experience almost NO loss on speed on download at all does not matter what server i connect to.  Though i do lose almost all of my upload data.

There is absolutely NO other VPN that i have seen so far that gives me this much data and quality and 0% headaches installing and using it.  Switching IPs is child's play with one click of a button. And my internet stays connected 100% of the time without any outages whatsoever  !!!   i will even go so far to saw that i can completely not understand at all that there are people out there giving this application a lesser score then 5 stars. I seriously can not rap my head around it. Those people must probably never have used any other VPN AT ALL.  Because other VPNs i used that where free are nothing more then a pain in the ass, long installments, and often blackouts meaning my internet connection would drop every so many minutes for a couple of seconds as the server crashed and i had to wait before it connected again.  If you see the Windscribe VPN ! Just stop looking further guys because these people give you so much quality, there is basically no other free VPN that will top this.

Between the plugin and the Windows program, the IPLeak site seems to pull up alternate credentials for the IPV4, so I must assume everything works as it should. The program also allows you to tell it of an alternate web or socks5 proxy if you use something separate to send your connections through outside of the VPN itself.

I had to disable the adapter for Windscribe and then re-enable it in Networks and Sharing to get it to work right and I haven't had issues since.

The limitation of *what* it could store was much more serious: secrets like crypto tokens or credit card numbers, equally important, didn't fit the mnemonic pattern scheme, and therefore couldn't be stored safely in a plain text file.

First, my profession (and my passion) is developing open source software, and closed-source, proprietary solutions were immediately off the table. None of the other remaining options checked off half the boxes boxes Bitwarden did, especially availability on all my devices (even in the browser!) and Internet synch on a self-hosted server. Bitwarden even checked off boxes I didn't even know I had, like automatic password filling inside the browser AND in Android apps. Bitwarden was clearly the top choice. I spent about an hour switching over, installing the Firefox extension on my Linux laptop and the Android app on my phone, and migrating some of my most-used passwords.My life has never been the same since. Managing passwords is now almost effortless no matter which device I'm using, and no longer limited to the old mnemonic system. I didn't initially realize Bitwarden could also help remember so many other secrets, like credit cards, identities, GPG and SSH keys, API tokens and more, eliminating all my ad-hoc systems and with them, those feelings of dread and anxiety.

I tried to find help on the LP problems but gave up. They don't seem to be interested. Lots of forum posts about it but I couldn't find any solutions. Another company took over and soon after doubled the subscription rate. Bitwarden is $10/year.

If you want to use a Yubikey, but then fall back to Google Authenticator, you can. Unlike Lastpass, where it's one or the other, something almost none of the other services I use 2fa with seem to restrict.I'm giving Bitwarden a try as Lastpass drops the ball on Firefox support.It's very clean, and quick. Parts of the interface are clunky (when you edit/save a new login, the giant green bar indicating that YAY YOU SAVED covers up ALL the useful buttons in the interface and doesn't time out nearly quickly enough, forcing you to click the X even to perform a simple task that shouldn't involve the notification.)It's not quite as good at detecting login pages and offering to save logins as Lastpass. If you ever need to toggle away to, let's say, copy a Authenticator code the extension completely closes and you have to re-type everything, even if you were in the middle of adding a new login. So even if you're only half-done, make sure to save even if your new entry is incomplete.It seems to especially fail to capture new logins if you have two-factor authentication enabled for your accounts (which really, you should, right?)It would be nice to create a folder/category for your login in the very same screen that you create a new login. It's clunky to create a login, then toggle over to settings, create a folder, then toggle back over to your vault, and finally assign the login a folder.The extensions don't sync automatically, or don't sync very often. Which means changes in your vault or in another browser don't sync until you manually click a button. That's an extra step that seems unnecessary.That said, I went ahead and paid for Premium even if I don't plan on switching away from Lastpass. It seems like there's a lot of room to focus on exactly what used to make Lastpass great, before it started to get bogged down in sluggish UI and doubled in price without any real increase to functionality."", 'I switched from lastpass to bitwarden, why you ask?

DO NOT USE YUBIKEY FOR TWO  FACTOR AUTHENTICATION - UNFORTUNATELY LASTPASS DOES NOT USE FIDO2 AS THE AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM AND INSTEAD USES THE YUBIKEY PSEUDORANDOM KEY GENERATOR THAT BECAUSE OF POOR IMPLEMENTATION BY LASTPASS MEANS IT REMAINS SUSEPTIBLE TO ATTACK AND LEAVES YOUR ENTIRE VAULT OPEN TO THIEVES. THIS IS A KNOWN SECURITY ISSUE AND IRONICALLY ONLY APPLIES TO PAYING CUSTOMERS. SINCE LASTPASS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THIS ISSUE, NO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN MADE. THIS TOGETHER WITH A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THEIR ISSUE MANAGEMENT RATES THIS AS 3 STARS AT BEST. THE remainder of the review relates to usability and is based on Lastpass\'s own publicity which given some of their representations at the time of this review regarding Yubikey being false, should be taken with that fact in mind. Lastpass is probably one of the more intuitive password managers on the market at the time of writing with integration into the widest number of websites and available on the widest number of platforms of all the consumer focussed password / identity management solutions. Security applications have for the most part been devoid of interfaces that make it simple for the end-user to use, or for the most part even understand, so in many ways LastPass\'s user interface is the main reason for its awards and subsequent user base. Functionally the range of features that come with Lastpass are impressive, if a little daunting for someone who has not seen its evolution as a piece of software and it can feel as though if you used all the features and functionality it contains – it can be used to keep secure notes and has multiple templates for recording other types of sensitive data besides passwords for websites – then you would be relying on a basket that would be holding a lot of heavy eggs. Templates include SSNs, WiFi Passwords, Bank accounts, payment cards, Insurance Details etc. and has the funtionality for creating your own templates (I created one for storing GPG Keys and another phone IMEIs among other things), that it really can feel that you could be left very exposed to identity theft if an exploitable security hole went unpatched. There is, as with all password managers, an issue that is core to single password information vaults. Your LastPass password may the the last password you\'ll ever need but it\'s also the only password you must never ever forget. Or divulge. And it needs to be good enough that it\'s not easily guessable.  For all these reasons I believe it\'s critical that some form of two factor authentication is used in addition to a strong password. The second authenticator can be hardware, e.g. software like Google Authenticator which generates a pseudo-random number generator app creates a new 6 digit authorisation code every 30 seconds. (Lastpass offer their own app for generating these numbers). It\'s why we all should have at least two front door keys (and not keep one under the flowerpot!) However the Achilles heel that all Vault based security apps struggle with: To ensure that only you can access your data also means that as there is no means of opening the vault if you forget your LastPass password, or lose the only source of authenticating you as the authorised user. LastPass have attempted to resolve this problem with a form of escrow that grants user nominated individuals access to the Vault in the event that the primary user is unable to input their password. I understand it is there primarily to help the family in circumstances where they need to take over management of the user\'s affairs. but the solution has a ""tacked on"" feel to it. Lastpass has made a strong commitment to ensuring their offering is secure which can be found on their website. Of all the password managers on the market I have found it to be the best and rate it highly, recommending it frequently. That said there are parts of the functionality which novice users and those who aren\'t IT literate do find it frustrating to use. I do think perseverence in learning is rewarded - there are substantial set of FAQs, active user forums, instructional videos, user support and guides which can be easily accessed.  Overall a very useful and powerful extension which provides a huge amount of tools to make your online life far more secure.', ""I've been using LastPass for years now on all browsers and haven't had any problems.

In my experience, most of the time it doesn\'t even ""see"" that you\'re singing up for a new account, so I have decided to open the LastPass Vault, click on the + (plus symbol) and create the account step-by-step.

LastPass often won\'t even recognize the site (the same URL that is in its database including what\'s after the slash, e.g. https://www.xyz.com/login).Often LastPass will post and indicate that it recognizes the page you\'ve loaded.

I\'ve been looking for a password manager to replace RoboForm but until I found Let Pass, I was about to pay $29.95 for ""RoboForm Pro"" and so far, I like it much better and it\'s free.  I imported all my secure information into it and no longer have to restrict it to 10 entries.  I don\'t have to worry about my passwords being online because so far I don\'t have any really sensitive information that could be stolen.Thanks for Let Pass...', ""Everyone who critisizes the fact that the passwords are not stored locally, does not understand how LastPass works. I am an IT professional and was very delighted to discover that LastPass makes my online experience much more secure than ever. All passwords are encrypted locally before uploaded to the server. That means that also LastPass staff cannot read them. Using LastPass' auto-login function renders any keylogger harmless, because one does not type in passwords anymore. It also can autofill forms with your credit card or bank account data. Most websites mask those entries. Thus - as you don't type it and as the data is not displayed - it makes online banking and credit card payment much safer. And on top of that it also makes credit card payments and online banking safe when you are in an internet cafe. Thanks to the brilliant idea of one-time passwords and detailed double-safety for selected items, noone can ever get control of your LastPass account or the data in it. Study closely how LastPass works and you'll find out it makes your sensitive data much safer. Of course, you should still regularly create a backup. No problem with the import and export function of LastPass. Kudos to the developers."", ""Used Roboform for years, with four licenses (two PCs, Palm app, and Roboform2go for my thumbdrive.)

Bookmarklets that let you use LP in *any* browser (Opera, Safari, you name it.)  The developers are very responsive, responding to users on their forums and regularly adding requested features. And the security is top-notch.  Everything is encrypted LOCALLY, on your PC--Lastpass's servers never see your actual data.Try it.  You'll wonder how you ever existed on the web without it."", 'Works with more sites for me than paid Roboform did, for free!Well behaved toolbar button.I like the encrypted online ""vault"" for sync and as a backup for hundreds of bits of info that I would die if I lost with a crashed/lost/stolen notebook. Thanks!', 'I have not installed any of these yet, but have been seeing users and the developers go back and forth about this product.  Here\'s how I see it.Plus: Sharing passwords.  This is important!  To those who don\'t like it, don\'t do it!  You don\'t have to share your data!  But the fact is, I\'m the one who sets up all of the accounts and passwords on my wife\'s laptop and mine and I use the same info on both, since the purchases are made from the same bank account and are sent to the same address!Negative: I don\'t like the idea of sending all of my data to any one server.  Users these days spend a lot of extra time finding apps that won\'t do that.  And let\'s face it, if someone can write your security software for your servers, then someone can hack it and since you advertise that you have all of our data in one place, you\'re a target for hackers and it happens all the time!The thing is, we don\'t know what can happen with it once all of it leaves our computers and goes to someone elses, lock, stock and barrel and that is quite different than a company\'s server being hacked and only losing one piece of our info, for that one web site.And to address the comment about your company being sold one day, if a company does buy this one, while they may not be eager to harm what the company does, there are a lot of stupid people who buy companies and radically change things and hose it all up.  Or they are the type that thinks something new is automatically better and try it and there goes our security!And the developer said that if this happened, it would be closely watched.  BY WHOM???  YOU\'RE GONE!!!  And the truth is, you\'re not going to announce it before hand so we can jump ship, because that would be a condition of the sale and it would hurt your chances of selling the company to someone anyway.  And yes, it would require an update to change the security on us, but so what?  They\'d offer it as an enhancement and so, we\'d think it was an improvement, not knowing what has changed and just download it and then its too late!  After all, they wouldn\'t tell us it\'s going to be bad for us. :)Negative: I don\'t see where this app has the ability to store and pull up receipts and to a pinhead like me who is constantly trying to remember who I bought something from and when, this is a nice feature, especially since I can never find my paper receipts either! :)So anyway, that\'s my take on it and I think, or at least I hope, that it sums up what people are going to great lengths to try to say to other users and to the developers.  And both sides can argue with these points, but they are facts.  They may not happen, but yes, they could, no matter how good one thinks their security is.So I hope this helped to sum up what folks are saying.  I also think that it doesn\'t make sense for any users to go off all crazy about ""what a scam"" it is, etc..  If they are telling you what they\'re doing, then by definition, it cannot be a scam. :)  You have a choice.  You are informed.And for the developers, I don\'t think it makes sense to keep talking about your security being so great, because your type of security has been hacked before and will be again and you are a target spot, since your software is known to collect all of a users info, so it\'s like one stop shopping for hackers!  I\'m not blaming you for that.  I\'m just saying that realistically, if someone can write the software that secures you, then that means that there\'s also someone who can hack it!

The perfomance of this service and the information available to Lastpass or its contractors are verified by YYY and traceable to ZZZ, etc.""; (iii) Lastpass provides IDtheft insurance up to $$$$.; (iv) once a user abandons the service, the removal of their information is certifiable by third parties.', ""I really like this addon.

This thing is great!!"", 'Does exactly what it says it will do.  This is by far the most well thought out password security system available through FF Add-ons.  Using on FF 3 and have had no issues whatsoever.  Bravo.', 'The LastPass login and formfill  functions do not work in windows/pages that have been switched to the IE rendering engine using Firefox Extension ""IE Tab"" (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419).Like all form fill and password managers that I have tried, it gets very confused when dealing with different login scripts (ie. //addons.mozilla.org vs //bugzilla.mozilla.org).It\'s automatic generation of passwords can be a real pain in the neck when trying to ""sign up"". Many times the log in for ""signing up"" is not the actual ""log in"". To retrieve the ""secure password"" generated for the actual ""log in"" can\'t be done. I have to end up send a request for a ""forgotten password"" and change the password to straighten things out. Very irritating! Needs to have a cleaner way to retrieve the newly generated password to use in a actual log in page!', ""This add-on as saved me multiple times. I've tried every kind of password backup/syncing strategy for the last month and finally settled for lastpass. It runs on windows, mac, and linux. Its form filler works like a charm. Its very secure, after looking into it, I'm not worried about people stealing my passwords. I only have a couple bank account passwords that I don't save into it because I don't visit them that often. (Even then, I wouldn't mind saving them.)To me this is a crucial add-on that should be built into firefox already. Why isolate your passwords onto one computer? Its basically like foxmarks but for passwords. You can even log into the website to view passwords if your on a friends or public computer. Also, I tried foxmarks to save passwords but it lacks the powerful auto fill and robustness that lastpass has. I have to give the creators serious credit. This is relatively new and I am constantly getting new updates that impress me more. They must be pretty determined to make this add-on successful. I made a request for a feature awhile back and it happened (multiple profiles). I also emailed them about having a problem saving my meebo password and recieved a reply the next morning! Meebo is a special case to save your passwords because it uses ajax. You just have to type your info in and BEFORE logging into and click save fill form data, then click to log in. Then next time it auto-fills your login. Other small tweaks I prefer is selecting the option to place the auto-login pop-up on the bottom and making the lastpass icon smaller to make it a little less obtrusive. (I also feel like this should be the default. . . but thats just my opinion.) Last side note, if you use firefox profile manager (ie '--profile manager' or '-P Bob') it installs last pass onto all your profiles. Its not a big deal because you can just uninstall it from the profiles you don't want it to use.Thanks lastpass!p.s. I have no affiliation with lastpass, I just think they deserve a good review from me for offering such a great free service."", 'What great joy and relief to find a Password Manager which is so practical and easy to use.

I'm so happy with this feature because it's something nobody else has.The only little bug I found was when I was changing a password the website would ask me to confirm my current password.

Or perhaps a far better solution would be one library which is part of the Firefox core which handles the sending of such data to these servies. We would need to be able to tell firefox to never let a certain extension call home, except via it\'s api for that library.Until such a day, I quite reasonably can not trust such apps and neither should anybody else. However I will use it to store logins to non important sites that I want to be able to access from anywhere.However, aside from the trust/security problems with the extension, technically it is perfect and is everything I have ever dreamed of in an online password manager. It works just like the Firefox default manager, except it\'s stored online. You guys are legends for pulling this off!!!===end of review but I continue with a more detailed report of the entire setup of the service on my pc, including the install and config of this extension==However while the final product is perfect, the install process and initial configuration is scary as %#$@. They get me to download an exe from their site when I could have just used this xpi!!! They then talk about removing my passwords from my computer and disabling the Firefox manager!!! Regardless I made a backup of everything as it was apparent they would try to do things without my permission.https://lastpass.com/faq.php#whynotbuiltinAfter reading this I was keen to see if they in fact could do as they say... but no, they asked for my master password, to which of course I hit cancel and then cancel again when it asked a second time. They then tell me that they can\'t find anything... HA! Stupid assuming FAQ entry!!! I was hoping that because I had not given them access to the passwords, they would not do anything stupid like disable it anyway or delete the file, but their phrasing in the dialog boxes wasn\'t at all comforting. Thankfully they left everything as is because I did not give them this password, however I then had to install this extension which for some reason was not added after the initial install (which now knowing about this extension, I wish I had never run).I install the extension and they yet again ask to grab all my passwords from firefox and I say ""no"" yet again. Then I go to a simple site that I don\'t mind giving away the password for. The default FF master password box pops up as there is a login form. I enter it and it auto fills my the login details like norm. However as soon as I submit the for that\'s when Last Pass kicks back into action... it comes up with a branded version of the ""Save this password?"" bar that firefox normally uses and allows me to save the password to their service. Perfect!!! I love this, it\'s great!!!Once set up using the method I described (starting at the xpi, not the exe) this should be a great way of keeping everything backed up on your own pc, but at the same time, making it accessible via their online service. Also it means that they are never actually reading from your password manager, so you don\'t have to trust that they won\'t automatically send everything to their server and won\'t go and delete everything either. This is how it should be, I want them to see what I want them to see, not everything like they are trying to do. Also why the hell should the password be deleted from my system? That is a big mistake!!! What if their company goes bust and they can\'t afford to keep everything running. There go all my passwords in one go because they deleted them from my system and now can\'t afford to keep the servers running so I can get my stuff back. Or it could be a fire or flood or data corruption or anything. This is my data, so they shouldn\'t be auto deleting it!But yeah if you follow my setup path and only use it to store non critical passwords until they fix the trust issue I mentioned, then you should be fine and this should be quite a useful extension.', 'The first free tool that is really is comparable to Roboform in functionality!

But if I switch back to group B again - then any active tab from A ""moves"" to group B.Disabling your addon resolves this issue.', '', '', ""This addon lets you correct one of Firefox's bigger usability problems: the unpredictability of which tab will be selected when you close a tab. It also does so with the minimum necessary permissions, which in an age of spying browser addons is something to appreciate.Firefox keeps some internal info about which tabs are 'children' of 'parent' tabs, and depending whether you have clicked around in the tab bar or not, may choose to activate some 'peer' of the closing tab rather than one adjacent to the closing tab. But this information is not communicated to the user at all, the tab bar appears to be just a list of tabs! I'm fairly technically literate and I find this behaviour stunningly confusing, I can only imagine how frustrating this must be to less technical users. I'm not even sure that this description of how it works is 100% right, and I've spent some time looking into it!In my opinion, Firefox's closing order for tabs without parent-child relationships (selecting the tab to the right) is also wrong. When you open a new tab, it is opened on the right. It only makes sense that closing a tab would select the tab to the left, taking you back toward where you began. The fault doesn't lie entirely with Firefox though, this is also Chrome's behaviour, and the Firefox team must feel much pressure to keep their interface consistent with the competition to make switching easy.But I digress. These are small user interface issues, but minor details like this can have major impact on the user experience. Kudos to the author for making this extension.The only flaw is that, when configured to select the tab to the left, there is a brief flash where the tab to the right is selected before switching to the tab to the left. I presume that this is due to a limitation of the current extension API, where the extension reacts to the tab closed event after the tab is gone and Firefox has already made its default next tab selection, and that nothing can be done to fix it. Unfortunate, but not a deal breaker!Users who care about tab opening behaviour are also encouraged to check out an about:config option added in Firefox 60, which positions new tabs to the right of the opening tab (instead of to the right of the current peer tabs, or at the end of the tab strip entirely):browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrent = true"", 'None of these add-ons works without activating the right tab when the active tab is closed.

It\'s so aggressive, however, that it destroys user experience and makes utilizing Cloudflare sites near unbearable. It does get past Cloudflare captchas, which are impassable on some sites due to an infinite loop. However, on any page featuring dynamic elements, multiple frames, or anything else beyond your basic HTML setup it flips out. It constantly reloads the pages for each element (resulting in a jarring, headache-inducing white flash between reloads), using a ticket every time too. It\'s rare to see this happen less than 3 times on any page to even start, really. Discus is a prominent example of an element where this will happen. Clicking ""show comments"" will cause the page to reload another several times, then scrolling down will cause it to constantly reload/reset. Pages with video streaming freakout and oftentimes don\'t work as a result. You\'ll see that on the initial load the video player is present, but after several white flashes it\'ll be gone. It\'s become my practice to only enable this for a single purpose; when encountering a page with an impassable catpcha, I enable this add-on, validate it using another Cloudflare site, get to the page I initially wanted/needed to visit, and immediately disable it again.
