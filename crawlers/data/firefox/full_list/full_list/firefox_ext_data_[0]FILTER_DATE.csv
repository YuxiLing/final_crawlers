Especially trying to log into your account. Metamask recommends that you log out of your wallet when your not using it which is good advice as you don't want to tell everyone how much you have. However, it virtually impossible to log back into your account with a simple cut and paste of your 12 secret words and passwords. Let me explain...First you copy your 12 secret words to paste into the box. However, as soon as you click anywhere else to paste your password, the metamask window disappears. When you open it again, it's asking for the 12 secret words again. So, your only option is to paste in either the secret words or your password, not both. One of them has to be done manually to keep the window open. Another frustration I had was when I recovered my wallet after it logs me out is after I had pasted in my 12 words, it asks me to create a new password. Now this is supposed to be a strong, secure password and I like to use at least 12 digits. So I create a new password but as I type it in, all I am seeing is the common security dots so I can't see what I'm typing. This means I can't type it twice like it asks and I can't copy and paste it anywhere. The fact that the Metamask window reverts back to the start whenever I click away from it and have to open it again makes it almost impossible to use conveniently using cut and paste.One more issue I have with Metamask is, whenever I close my browser, my settings delete history and cache. This means I have to recover my wallet every time I open my browser. It also means I lose all of the account names and have to enter them again.This is a great app but the user interface is a nightmare and needs to be sorted. Metamask NEEDS to be able to save your settings even if you clear your cache.I'm giving Metamask a 2 star rating only because it does work once you work out how to enter your information without the ability to cut and paste"", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'very well', 'Defacto standard dapp utility.

Firefox on my home computer was updated with 4.29 although the mozilla add-on site only has version 4.17 available. Version 4.17 has been reported for many not working and does the login link loop instead of applying the coupon.  On my work computer i was not able to port extension from chrome and ended up copying the extension XPI from home computer to work computer and now its working again.  I'm disappointing that Rakuten who have been aware of this issue are not updating the add-on for fire fox which suggest they have less interest (for an unknown reason) to support Firefox.   The extension can also be ported to work with Opera."", '', '', 'After the update to Rakuten I have been unable to use the add-on.

It took a learning curve for me to become conditioned just to remember to use the Ebates link. The fact that I can have it appear in my task bar, positioned just above where most online companies\' shopping carts are located, is a huge advantage for me to click on it before checking out. Most often, with more online retailers than I ever realized, the Ebates taskbar icon ""pulsates"" to alert me that the online retailer that I\'m shopping offers Ebate discounts. All I have to do is click it and confirm that my ""shopping trip"" will apply all applicable coupons and available cash back. What\'s best about cash back, is that it\'s often quite significant, especially with large purchases, such as bags of horse feed from Blain\'s Farm & Fleet, or a set of tires through Tire Buyer. I\'ve received cash back an average of $8.00 to $18.00 even after receiving the best sale prices. Originally, I thought it was too good to be true, but it functions reliably and as easily as described. I highly recommend giving it a try by first joining Ebates, then allowing the prompt to load the icon onto the task bar. Unlike lots of other programs that want access to the task bar, it doesn\'t alter your primary set-up or preferred defaults.

Such absolutism (all-or-nothing think) is rarely useful to anyone. So, first, throw out all of the 1's and 5's and dig deeper into the reviews that have actual thoughtful analysis of the product. In this particular experience, the Capital One add-on, Eno, is wonderfully useful... when it works. For me, a frequent online shopper, it provides two things I value highly: convenience and security. I love having it available at shopping sites, with all the info I need to complete the purchase. I don't have to look up my card info and manually fill it in. Very nice. Sadly, some updates to Firefox and a few sites' code break the add-on. But I've found this to be true of many of the add-ons I use. Anytime an app or an operating system pushes out an update, it's not uncommon for software that interacts with it to break or have issues. So, this is not a particular sin of this add-on. It applies to many add-ons.Most importantly, I love Eno and the feature from Capital One to use a virtual number. The add-on just makes it easier to use. One can still interact with the Capital One website to manage their virtual numbers. Due, once again to occasional breaks from browser updates or particular sites, I have had to get creative when using the feature. This can be frustrating. It's not perfect, but overall, it works more than it doesn't, and the ability to generate a one-time use number is invaluable when it comes to online security. Keep in mind, the virtual number feature is very flexible. You can keep using the number for that particular site, but lock it, so it's only usable when you allow it, you can just delete it, or leave it unlocked for one particular merchant only (e.g. for a subscription).If you're not using a virtual number, you are asking to be hacked.

But after 2 months, I have mostly changed my mind.  I\'m leaving my old review below, but here is a new perspective and 3 more stars, for 4 stars total.I had no trouble installing this or using it many many times afterwards.  It has worked, as far as I can tell, exactly as CapitalOne wants it to work. It was different from my Bank of America Shop Safe, so at first I hated it.  But I have found a way to use it well.  It has a drawback I will describe, but in some ways its also better. Here is how I use it.1. Keep the extension disabled, except when you need a new virtual credit card number.  That way it cannot spy on you at every website you go to.  When you need one, enable it, get the virtual card number and record it in your password vault.  Disable the extension.  The only problem here is that you must have a website open to ""attach"" the virtual number to.  I have been able to occasionally get a number that is not yet attached to a site, but I cannot repeat it.  When I can, I will add that info here.  But you are not actually limited to that website.  You can even use the number over the phone.  It appears that the number is permanently attached to the first credit processor that uses it, like ShopSafe was.  This is very useful, because giving number over the phone to a human is much more dangerous than typing it into a computer.  (CapitalOne - Please support getting numbers that are independent of a website!!  Thanks!)Your charge goes pending at first, so you cannot delete virtual card right away.  But every time you get a new one, check for old ones that you can delete.  This was my substitute for being able to define an expiration date in ShopSafe.  Its not automatic, and you cannot set a maximum charge amount, but it seems good enough.  That said, I decided I did not actually have to delete them every time.  As long as I knew who I gave it to, if I got any bogus charges, I would know where the problem was.  And since the number is probably locked to the first card processor that uses it, it is unlikely that it could be used by anyone who stole it in an IT breach from a company where I used it.  I could probably have done this with ShopSafe too, but didnt realize it.  Now I feel comfortable using it for recurring charges also.So...I am pretty happy right now.  If I stopped being able to use a number over the phone, I would probably go looking for another credit card to replace this.  Using it over the phone is not officially supported and this is the main reason I only have it 4 stars.  The other reason is that I have to enable and disable it every time I use it.  But thats not too onerous.  Thanks Capital One!  Sorry for the misunderstanding at first....*********** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***********If you are looking for a ShopSafe replacement (recently cancelled by Bank of America) Eno based virtual credit card numbers from a CapitalOne card are not for you.  These virtual credit card numbers do not give you the same protections from online fraud and do not work the way you would expect.  First, you must use this app to create and manage virtual numbers.  There is no website that I can find.  This app is ""always on"" and watching your browsing activity to look for a site it thinks you might want a virtual credit card number for.  So your browsing activity is no longer private.  You cannot create a virtual card number until the app sees you on such a site.  I was able to activate it on a dummy site, but then it links that URL to the credit card number.   It set the expiration date of the virtual credit card 5 years into the future, oddly, past the expiration date for my real Capital One credit card.  You cannot set a virtual number to expire after a certain number of months, like you could for ShopSafe numbers.  Likewise, you cannot set a maximum charge amount for a virtual number, so anyone who gets this can charge as much as they like.  So Eno virtual credit card numbers don\'t protect you from an unscrupulous online vendor, like ShopSafe did.  In fact, if you read the Terms and Conditions, you will see that the virtual number may not even be locked to a specific merchant, like ShopSafe was.  They appear to be testing this, but ""...a VC# you create for use Merchant A should work at Merchant A, but may or may not work at Merchant B.""  So in my opinion, this does not really protect me very much.  In fact, since there are no limits on the merchants and you cannot limit the maximum amount nor set a short expiration date, it may make you more vulnerable to fraud.  If someone steals a virtual number from a company you gave it to, they can use it just as if they stole a card from your wallet.  The only reasonable thing you can really do is delete the virtual number, but that assumes you know it was stolen.  We usually dont find out about that until long long after it happens. In fairness, unlike other reviews, I will say that I had no problems using my phone number to validate (via text messages) and get this set up.  Setup worked just fine.I am thinking carefully, because I really want a ShopSafe alternative, but this credit card will probably go back.', 'I\'m a long-time Capital One Banking customer.  After BofA discontinued their virtual credit card numbers (""ShopSafe"") I opened a Capital One Savor One card account for the SOLE PURPOSE OF USING VIRTUAL NUMBERS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING.  After receiving the card and attempting to set up Eno I was frustrated by the inability to log into my account / verify my account, which requires the ability to receive an SMS text.  I do not have a mobile phone, and the Google Voice account that I have isn\'t ""acceptable"" to the Eno verification process.  Every other financial account or service that I have (and there are almost a dozen of them, not including the IRS..) allows me to verify either by a phone call, a hard-copy mailed PIN, or an email sent to the address on file.  It appears that Capital One doesn\'t care much about their customer\'s needs or requirements, since the only option being provided for Eno verification is the SMS/text of an identifier.  After an hour with Tech Support and an escalation to a supervisor I\'ve been told ""this is the way it is"".  So non-mobile phone users are automatically excluded as Eno users.  That is blind thinking.Since I can\'t use Eno I\'ve decided to open a competitor\'s card account (the one remaining provider of virtual card numbers), and while I\'m at it I may as well move my banking accounts as well.  I already have too many accounts at different institutions.If this isn\'t fixed in 90 days I\'ll have no need for the Savor One card.

Whilst the reporting in the daily mail is heavily biased, this is not what newsguard claims to rate.Furthermore - rather than criticise newsguard for changing the rating for the daily mail from red to green (as they recently did), I admire their openness to change.  The mail previously rated less well for openness, probably because when contacted by newsguard originally they weren\'t forthcoming with the information requested, and deservedly got rated badly for openness.  Once the mail made this information available newsguard rightly changed their rating.I think the most helpful review below is unsurprisingly the most considered one, by concentricbrainwaves.  I also agree that having an amber rating would be helpful, and in the case of the daily mail, would probably be appropriate.

I think it's important to note that bias is almost entirely irrelevant to the goal of NewsGuard. NewsGuard doesn't tell you whether sites are biased, just whether they're telling you the truth.

Perhaps *White* should mean ""so far as can be detected this site is trying to get it right"" and *Amber* should mean ""there is some doubt about the veracity of some items on this site"" with, in both cases, a link to more detail. A third colour (Blue?) would be useful to indicate news aggregators with a legend along the lines of ""This is a news aggregation site. Please check source articles on the originating sites"".Finally, it is disappointing that a particular print-and-online ""news"" publication recently had it\'s rating changed from ""Red"" to ""Green"" without changing its editorial stance in any way. To my mind ""Red"" was thoroughly deserved because the publication presents opinion as if it were fact and habitually spins news to such a degree that it winds up seeming to mean the opposite of the original facts. Others will disagree with me on that assessment but independently verifiable ""facts"" are ""the news"" which the reader should interpret whereas ""opinion"" is someone else\'s (often malicious and politically motivated) interpretation.

Turns out the page was in separate container than the last time I had allowed those permissions. The permissions are *CONTAINER SPECIFIC*. I hadn't really properly put Multi-User Container add-on really to good use!Now I don't lose permissions. I can have certain (all possible to keep things working) Google servers blocked on default - same with any FaceBook servers. In fact, FaceBook servers are only allowed on FaceBook container. And if a site that does not belong to YouTube container, but needs to show video from YouTube, I either temporarily allow the servers, or I move the site into YouTube container; which needs a good good reason if it's not a Google's YouTube services. OR, I'll add another container for pages that don't need all the YouTube and Google servers allowed, but need to have just those allowed that let the videos roll; and move that site there. This is in fact incredibly great way to work, although I still miss the Legacy version - I will soon try changing to a fork that has all the modern support of FF, and support for legacy add-on's. Then I can use the original, and get the massive power of ABE, but will the Legacy code be updated to have same support for multiple containers? That I would love, best of both worlds.I even have a container for MyWOT.com, which everyone should know already is a scam itself, but the user reviews are real - and great. So that container shouldn't be able to reach any info not loaded while in that very container. And only MyWOT.com ever is.P.S.

All issues have been verified by disabling NoScript: without it no issues occur, with it enabled all occur, so it is the sole cause.First, after a while, as others have reported, Firefox just stops working and will show nothing. From the console, it looks like NoScript has broken the Firefox origin policy on everything. Where is it trying to import scripts from?The problem, reported on the NoScript forum that pages on local disks are broken since 10.1.9.2 on Firefox 61.0.2 remains. The scripts (used to) run but incorrectly also showed the content of < noscript >. A moderator proved this with a use case but the report has now been deleted. In Firefox 62.0, it is now worse. The page may load once (incorrectly) if you are lucky, then if you reload it stops (previous point). There is no facility in the current UI to specify permission for local pages (I think there was before the big change to the Firefox api)Somewhere, probably in 10.1.9.2, the user list of allowed and blocked sites has been corrupted. 10.1.9.4 was supposed to fix this and recover the situation but hasn't [on the first or second runs].As you just seem to delete some issues reported on your forums, please don't ask me to post there.

The new interface is Terrible to put it mildly. Its over \'simplification\' and design has produced a bewildering experience that makes ones head ache in a state of near vertigo when first used. Just to add insult to injury, as previously stated, you will probably have repeat the process when the settings are forgotten.No script has always been annoying when visiting a site for the first time. Identifying the minimum scripts allowed for site functionality whilst blocking the rest, was a tedious process but it was offset by the fact it only had to be done once. The result was a huge dividend of security, privacy, speed of page load, reduced memory usage and increased stability to the browser as a whole from avoiding execution of unnecessary and in many cases poorly written, bloated code.In short the new NoScript is a horrible disappointment, in stark contrast to the wonderful browsing experience of Firefox 57""At that time I felt the review was completely justified.But, there is hope!The UI is improving and in some ways, superior to the old which I think we all have to agree was a bit clumsy.I understand now the \'forgetting\' of settings directly attributable to the API changes in Quantum and Mozillas role in it and the unfair but understandable scorn from users like myself who have become accustomed to features being removed and UI changes from likes of Microsoft and others in the name of \'progress\' and our willingness to unload both barrels as a result.I persisted with noscript, temporally allowing just about everything, relying on Sandboxie protection.It improves with every update to my everlasting gratitude and I cannot wait for the day I rate it 5 stars!THANK YOU to the developer(s) for all of your hard work and persistence in the face of mounting criticism from people like myself.No Script is in my opinion a vital extension for security, privacy, stability, user control and the enrichment of the browsing experience...', '', '', ""Thank you for the interface changes!

Overall, I think the current version of NS is quite smooth to use. The current UI is understandable but it is still far from perfect. However, I think it is worth to trade some convenience for better security.I have the following suggestions for NS. Some of them were suggested before indeed.1. Include a button to allow all scripts globally in the main UI. Sometimes when we do something really important, such as making a payment online, we would like to allow all scripts globally and temporarily. Having the button in the main UI would save us a few seconds each time. In contrast, the button ""Temporarily allow all this page"" has very little practical use in my opinion.2. As some other users pointed out, get rid of the ""slider"" thing. It takes up too much space so it makes the list of scripts unreadable. It also makes the position of the buttons not consistent.3. The list of scripts can be sorted in a better way. List the blocked scripted at the top and the allowed scripts at the bottom.Overall, I think the current version of NS is much better than 2 months ago and it does what it is supposed to do now. NS seems to be the only firefox addon which provide protection beyond blocking javascripts. It worth 4 or 5 stars in my opinion.

Simpler might be less safer, but if the alternative is not using it at all, it\'s still better. Way better.- get rid of the slider. It looks mhm good(?), but its not recognizable as one.- there is way to much clickable stuff, one does not get what is a button, what a link and whatnot...- make it simpler: hide everything exept: domain name, status icon and -depending on the status- two buttons for each entry.- clear design, dont change font size and font color at any time- No xss-popups. In fact, never, ever use popups.Instead:- a simple list of domains like before, each with a status icon in front of it: your blue ""S"", for allowed, same with a little clock for temporarily allowd,  red crossed ""S"" for disallowed - depending on the current status of an entry, two buttons: - if currently allowed:  ""disallow"" and ""temp. disallow"" - if currently disallowed:  ""allow"" and ""temp. allow""- these buttons need to be different than the status icon. I would use red X and green hook/check, each with and without a little clock.- dont make anything but the buttons clickable! not the text, not the status icon. Thats it. You can add a (clearly seperated from the other buttons, clearly different graphic) button behind each list entry to hide all the detailed settings, for the expert. Everybody else gets the simple list.

Under the old version, it only gave me an XSS warning for a certain few websites which I could then do an unsafe reload.

Thank you, Giorgio for that.I do blame Mozilla somewhat for switching to a substandard extension API and not having certain vital API features available to developers to test until very late (and some not even yet existing). I realise there were some reasons to make the change, but they should have considered the effect on the existing users and developers and tried to mitigate it somehow.While I agree that expressing such anger in obscene words is inappropriate, it is appropriate to give an honest review and rating. My rating expresses what I currently think about this addon and is by no means an emotional reaction to change.

Maybe the developer could implement very quickly a joker system allowing to enter domains like :*.akamai.net*.hd.akamai.netIn first case we allow every subdomain of akamai.netIn the second case we limit to every subdomain of hd.akamai.net2) No synchornization optionIdeally, NoScript should store the users data in cloud through the Firefox account as ScripSafe does in the Google Account.But maybe it is not possible according to the Firefox account policy, so the workaround should be to be able to synchronize data to/from a local path on the computer.One just have to create this path in a OneDrive or Google Drive synchronized directory...and this should be done.I have several computer, each computer has several users session, this is just annoying to set up NosSript for each repeating always the same process. And when I set up a new computer, I must restart from the beginning.With ScripSafe, this is very easy... the extension automatically download and upload to Google Accounts (one must activate such option).If ScripSafe is ever ported to Firefox with the same functionalities, I drop NoScript3) Slow GUIAs today, the NoScript GUI is I N C R E D I B L Y slow.As a comparison ScripSafe is incredibly fast to display the distant hosts listBut this version is a kind of quick done dirty version, let\'s be patient, this will be probably fixed in the future, but developer must know that the situation is as today not acceptable. I also suspect that NoScript 10  slows down the browser4) Inefficient filtering mechanismIn the former XUL extension, the filtering engine of NoScript was crappy as it was oftenly forgetting a lot of distant host.So one needed sometimes to switch to ""allow all scripts"" to see these hosts, and go back to ""forbide all scripts"", and so we could set rules for theses invisible hosts.As compared, ScripSafe was far better as there was not such issues.Finally.... XUL NoScript is dead and this is a very good thing because the filtering engine of NoScript was outdated and the author didn\'t want to admit that.Let\'s see now if this brand new Web Extension addresses such issues, I can\'t say at this moment.', 'Best stuff you can have on Firefox.

How am I supposed to test a website? Giving it permanent permissions and later revoking them again is not a very effective way.There are still a lot of things to be done.

Also, the options screen is severely lacking, a lot of the behaviour I used to customise can\'t be changed right now. I assume that all of these things are still possible, and just haven\'t been implemented yet.

The main icon button, meanwhile, displays the current permission(s) for that site and any 3rd party elements. I have often wished for a toggle feature to reverse the menu icons. :)For the advanced user, you can explicitly deny all and create a custom ""whitelist"" of the sites and servers you need access to.

However, to speed things up further, before posting your question, I would recommend that you first search the forum for answers. For example, if you search for references to Ghostery, you're likely to find out all you need to know about the relationship between NoScript and Ghostery. If you have any difficulty, then ask, and I'm sure you'll get a reply within a day.Lest I break the review guidelines myself ;), I'll repeat my earlier opinion: With NoScript, I can surf the web without fear, but I feel very exposed without it. It gives me control of my browsing experience, and single-handedly keeps me from seriously considering Chromium as my primary browser (ScriptNo is just not equal to it, although the full NoScript is coming to Chrome eventually). It has a 'training period', while you go to your regular sites and tell it to trust them, but then it will remember them and you can use them normally. Sure, it's still in your face when you're browsing around to sites you've never visited before, but that's exactly when you need the protection. Far and away my favorite addon. And for anyone who thinks that they can just turn off JavaScript, or that JavaScript isn't really dangerous, take a look at noscript.net/features and see how much more NoScript actually does."", 'One of the best add-ons ever.', ""Using this add-on for a long time now, and is one of the first I install on every new Firefox profile.Security isn't the only thing i care about, 'cause besides the good security it offers, blocking a multitude of possibly malicious content, it also manages as a “side-effect” to lighten the pages you visit, so you'll save time, bandwidth and, very important, system resources, which make it an excellent choice on low-performance computer.If configured properly, it's a powerful tool.

When No Script is blocking everything on a webpage, I go to Collusion Graph and there are no trackers, while temporarily disabling No Script for that webpage, trackers appear on the graph. Also, since all content is blocked, advertisement is nullified. Does this mean I can just skip add-ons such as AdBlock Plus and Ghostery? Will NoScript alone deal with all the trackers on the web?

First of all, the developer whitelists his own websites. That\'s giving his relatively unknown (I\'ve known deviantArt and a lot of other websites in his whitelist before, but not his) websites a special status on many people\'s computers, namely that he can run JS on them by default, which most other websites can\'t. He argues on his FAQ that he with NoScript already has code running on my computer so I should trust him, but I don\'t agree with this argument. What if someone gets in on his server and puts malicious code on it? That\'s no longer about how much I trust him then. You say that won\'t happen? Well, I say the same about my website. Also, I trust that mozilla peer-reviews submissions, and thus he doesn\'t dare putting anything bad in. I don\'t necessarily trust his websites. Last but not least, I think a security related application should come with the minimum possible whitelisting. I want it ""secure by default"", and not stumble upon a FAQ entry telling me ""hey, by the way, my own websites are whitelisted by default and if you don\'t like that, you have to remove them"". He also argues that frequent updates are critical for security related applications, and I agree with that - but why ""go soft"" when it comes to his own websites and start ""making exceptions""?Second, I found some UI elements confusing, in particular the ""Allow Scripts Globally"" warnings. After reading them, I am not sure - do they mean that NoScript will behave as if it wasn\'t installed? Or does it mean that scripts get even more privileges than that? The ""Dangerous!"" warnings seem to imply the latter. Rewording the warnings might clarify this a bit. The review from January 23, 2011, which apparently had no effect, probably says it better than I do - from the wording, it feels like it\'s going to override my browser security settings, and not just disable NoScript.

I\'ve been using it for a several years.  However, there are some serious caveats.I\'m editing my review after another year of use.  I\'m getting so sick of NoScript.  I\'m sure it very often blocks scripts I don\'t want, but how often does it block something truly malicious?  The ""Temporarily Allow All"" button is absolutely critical.  I don\'t know how I ever lived without it.  But you still have to click the Temp All button for just about everything.  In fact, you have to click the button multiple times for many sites.  It may be because a site is drawing scripts from different domains for each page image.  Either way, it has become horrendously irritating dealing with NoScript, but I\'m still afraid to get rid of it.  I may run a test on a linux machine with only AdBlock Plus (which does a wonderful, totally unobtrusive job) to see if I can live without NoScript.  I\'m getting close to the point of thinking that I can.  I\'m just so tired of having to dick around with every single page.I\'ve also taken to allowing all top-level domains.  That helps a lot.Second, I agree that there are way too many updates.  One update a week is fine, but NoScript seems to update all daily -- many of these are tiny, incremental fixes.  We don\'t need a new version deployed every single time some little thing is changed.  Has anyone had a compromised machine because you were 0.0.0.1 version from the latest?Overall, it\'s recommended only for very advanced users.

To not use NoScript because most of the websites you visit ""are likely ok"" misses the point of the tool entirely.  Web attacks are the vector of choice today, and NoScript is possibly the most important tool one can use to avoid them.  Literally millions of users run on compromised systems in bot-nets today, with their owners not having the slightest idea they\'ve been taken over... which makes them a threat to others.  These days, it\'s naive, and arguably irresponsible to _not_ use NoScript.  Sites that are ""likely ok"" can easily be added to the whitelist, while still letting NoScript protect from the unknowns.  However, many scripts that sites want to run on one\'s system have nothing to do with the functionality of the site and can be left turned off.Re the idea of just blacklisting - Blacklisting assumes the user can stay aware of every bad site on the planet.

Here's what I have to say about it:NoScript has several layers of blocking intrusive elements in webpages, including ones that anti-virus solutions cannot block as of yet. It has the ability to block scripts, ActiveX controls, Flash/Silverlight plugins, and even cookies from being installed on your system without your knowledge AND permission, so this way, it ends up working better than any other solution to date in keeping those unwanted addons off your personal space! I will admit myself that the benefit of this is NOT just in theory, since it actually saved me from such intrusions at least several dozen times since I picked it up about seven months ago. Another feature of note here (and also the one that made me dump IE for a Gecko-based browser) is one that blocks all sorts of zero-day hijackings and exploits that IE and all browsers based on its code tend to get torn to ribbons by, including clickjacking, cookie hijacking, fake-HTTPS related attacks and other such constructs commonly used by scammers. Now, about the functionality for blocking scripts and other such site objects: when certain site script URLs are brought up in the XSS blocking popup, I would recommend looking up the script's ratings in MyWOT or a similar resource before enabling or disabling it as part of your whitelist (just type in the URL of the script into the search box at the top of MyWOT's webpage). If you would be so inclined, though, you could just enable the script of the page that you are viewing and NOT any other scripts from outside, since oftentimes, webpages do NOT require scripts from other URLs to retain all functionality, unless they are subdomains of the script's webpage. The only thing I can see that would be desired, though, would be the functionality for placing sites in a blacklist to accompany the whitelist, so that those sites will NEVER load under any conditions unless you say otherwise. At that, it would also be desirable to have this setup so that such domains could blocked (and all of their objects coming from them!) WITHOUT having to visit them directly, even though I do know that Firefox provides blocking of URLs out of the box. Overall, after extensive testing of the addon, I have yet to run into any sort of severe problems with it. I sure hope Giorgio and crew intend on keeping in mind the suggestions of those who use their NoScript tool, since doing so would only stand to make it better than how it already is! As I said before, now that I have this tool to keep me safe, going back to IE seems like walking right into a minefield: it's both dangerous and NOT worth the returns.."", ""A great extension to improve your security. If you ever wanted to have more control over whcih sites to allow Javascript, Flash, and any other plugins to run, this is your answer. It can also help you block junky scripts you don't want.

Absolutely necessary for everyone.', 'I like NoScript.  However, it has some shortcomings that I feel need to be addressed.Primarily, I want the ability to review all potentially dangerous scripts on  a page before running them. NoScript will not post specific scripts on a web page if you are blocking that site.  On the ""blockable elements on current page,"" ironically it will only show elements on the page that you are currently *not* blocking.  All specific javascript js files are not shown if they are being blocked.  So I might be blocking an entire website, but I don\'t know specifically which scripts I am blocking from that website.For example,  try visiting mycokerewards.com (it will probably crash Firefox).  If you have not allowed mycokerewards.com, it will show a list of blockable items on the current page, but none of them are the elements which cause the page to crash Firefox for me. In order to see the elements which cause the page to crash, you have to ""allow"" mycokerewards.com, and once you do that, I get a spinning PWOD (beachball) and Firefox stops functioning and I am never able to see a list of blockable elements, including the scripts which are causing the page to crash.  This for me is a fatal flaw in an otherwise great program.  I do run NoScript and will continue to.  However, if you come across a website that is unusable, for the average user like me, it is not possible to see all dangerous elements without unblocking the site and then by the time you have the chance to try to view them, you get a nonresponsive browser, nonresponsive NoScript, and no updated list of blockable items so you cannot try to figure out the culprit.  I would like to be able to slowly add one dangerous script in at a time to a troublesome page, to see if I can isolate which scripts are causing the site to crash Firefox.  NoScript works for pages that don\'t cause Firefox to stop functioning, but it does not work for sites that cause Firefox to stop functioning.  And there should be the ability to view *all* blockable elements on a page, including the ones that are currently being blocked.  I should not have to ""allow"" certain sites in order to view more blockable elements on the page.  They should all be viewable to me and I should be able to control all of them.  Control should not be given to me only after I have allowed the website, for by then if the website crashes Firefox it is too late.', ""I'm still telling it which sites to allow and forbid and it's starting to move more into the background of my surfing.

I surf a lot, my bookmarks-file contains several hundred locations.

For many reasons I prefer to hinder 'dubious' scrips of also strange servers to run on my machine. And if I know such a server exactly, as well as I know the necessary script, I allow this permanently - that's it. But since I know, that almost nothing in the world wide web is constantly 'reliable', I prefer to enable most of the scripts temporarily. The only places I allow permanently are local scripts like configuration scripts (for example of my router).If one really is disturbed by always blocked scripts, one should reflect about the meaning of the term 'security' and the personal skills around this topic. If you, pezzonovante, are experienced enough or you dislike such blocking, why do you install NoScript?There are lots of users who desire this kind of security and know very well what they want to allow to run (and that is - for sure - less than 50% of all scripts on the average of pages out there) on their machines. NoScript gives us the ability to choose the level of security according to our 'feeling'. Those, who are permanently annoyed can simply uninstall NoScript, so no necessity of such strange modifications like that one you told - I don't like such rare experiments. And especially to you: WOT isn't made to collect sites running 'insecure' scrips or stuff, which is possible harmful (you should look for information about WOT and its intention  p r i o r  to post such statements at this place).

Everything blocked until you open it. Which is easier to maintain? Most people who aren\'t long-termers on the systems side will say everything is good until you say it\'s bad.  This puts the burden upon you to block the troublemakers.  If it\'s blocked until you open it, the only holes in the system will be the ones you punch.NoScript takes the first view - notify, but verify.

The limitation of *what* it could store was much more serious: secrets like crypto tokens or credit card numbers, equally important, didn't fit the mnemonic pattern scheme, and therefore couldn't be stored safely in a plain text file. Instead, I resorted to multiple other ad-hoc systems, like pieces of paper or dedicated flash drives or even just memory, which I constantly dreaded would be leaked, lost or forgotten, a major source of anxiety for me.When I went looking for a solution (and I was really only trying to replace my password system), Bitwarden immediately stood out. First, my profession (and my passion) is developing open source software, and closed-source, proprietary solutions were immediately off the table. None of the other remaining options checked off half the boxes boxes Bitwarden did, especially availability on all my devices (even in the browser!) and Internet synch on a self-hosted server. Bitwarden even checked off boxes I didn't even know I had, like automatic password filling inside the browser AND in Android apps. Bitwarden was clearly the top choice. I spent about an hour switching over, installing the Firefox extension on my Linux laptop and the Android app on my phone, and migrating some of my most-used passwords.My life has never been the same since. Managing passwords is now almost effortless no matter which device I'm using, and no longer limited to the old mnemonic system. I didn't initially realize Bitwarden could also help remember so many other secrets, like credit cards, identities, GPG and SSH keys, API tokens and more, eliminating all my ad-hoc systems and with them, those feelings of dread and anxiety.

If you ever need to toggle away to, let's say, copy a Authenticator code the extension completely closes and you have to re-type everything, even if you were in the middle of adding a new login. So even if you're only half-done, make sure to save even if your new entry is incomplete.It seems to especially fail to capture new logins if you have two-factor authentication enabled for your accounts (which really, you should, right?)It would be nice to create a folder/category for your login in the very same screen that you create a new login. It's clunky to create a login, then toggle over to settings, create a folder, then toggle back over to your vault, and finally assign the login a folder.The extensions don't sync automatically, or don't sync very often. Which means changes in your vault or in another browser don't sync until you manually click a button. That's an extra step that seems unnecessary.That said, I went ahead and paid for Premium even if I don't plan on switching away from Lastpass.

Also no arbitrary small data limits either. Windscribe used to be pretty good but has deteriorated over time.update 12/17/20: THe high star ratings this vpn gets are testament NOT to it\'s quality but to the very poor performance of all ""free"" vpns. When it works, it works reasonably well, but most of the time it\'s just FLAKY. Cannot connect because it cannot find the open browser tab even when the browser is connected to a site. Very few ""free proxies"" They make you hunt for them and their GUI is a PITA to use, slow and cumbersome. Today their servers lost my login info and I had to relogin cuz they could not recognize that I was a long time user. I wonder if ANY of these ""FREE"" vpns will ever amount to anything. Not holding my breath and from their ""FREE"" services performance, not sending them any money either.update 12/2/20: Much better last week. stable servers mostly, still hard to find the free ones requires a lot of clicks. often get the ""cannot find tab"" error requiring closing of browser ff and reloading. Connects sometimes automatically on browser open which is good. The user interface could be made more user friendly and easier to use. Takes too much time to navigate to what you want. mini popups to explain the buttons are in order.update: 11-18-20: really deteriorated, extremely slow both to connect and in data transfer. Very few free proxies, takes forever to find one. Diconnects on ""autopilot"" so even they cannot find a working proxy. Obvious they do not want free users. Had trouble connecting to make this review maybe being blocked? Another lame ""free"" proxy. BS.Better than most, BUT same as all the others-will not allow access to any website that uses software to ID proxies. None of the free vpns do this and most of the paid ones do not either. You need residential proxies for that and they cannot afford to offer that for free. So if a webpage is blocking proxies you\'re SOL-u will not get in. Same for sites like netflix. SO SLOW ACROSS SEVERAL PROXIES THAT IS IT ALMOST UNUSABLE. in firefox but kudos that they kept my login credentials even after over a year not using-shows they are professional.

Be very careful and install at your own risk.  By the third day, I have Re-installed Fedora 30 and Re-formatted the partitions and only installed   mozilla-noscript   from the Fedora repository and only installed   HTTPS Everywhere   from the Firefox add-ons.By the third day of testing, fiddling and using this add-on, I had lost the trust and confidence for this add-on.  My last Fedora 30 was only installed a week ago with only the default packages.  I had only NoScript and HTTPS Everywhere in Firefox that I had used for years.  Windscribe was the only extra add-on.With Windscribe:1)  By the third day, I had to enter the url at least 3 times before it start loading.  Websites kept reloading.  It was slow with this add-on ON and its was not useable.  I had to set it to OFF for Firefox to work.2)  ifconfig   showed that about 30 MiB, the total of all the   tun   and   WiFi   Tx and Rx traffic, whereas the Windscribe counter showed more than 100 MiB used.  There was no download or Video for the three days.  2.5 GiB consumed for just Text and some images in the last three days!  That is not possible.Can someone out there check what is actually going on using network tools like Wireshark, etc.?Ok.  I will do it on my own using OpenVPN and Cisco IPsec.Firefox should invest the resources to review all add-ons for all updates before allowing them to ride on its Browser as it could break its useability and much worse, plant sinister and malicious codes in its add-on.THE INTERNET IS FULL OF SECURITY FLAWS.  IT IS UP TO ALL OF US TO PUT IN THE HEART AND SOUL TO MAKE IT GOOD INSTEAD OF EVIL.  THEN THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE WORLD IS BAD FOR ANYONE.--------2 days ago reviewWow, Windscribe is really some Security and Privacy Services.  Using   sudo yum install windscribe-cli   from   /etc/yum.repos.d/windscribe.repo   was seamless.  windscribe viewlog show the line OpenVPN 2.4.7 x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu which is a native TRUE VPN which is, my desktop is connected direct to a France exit point through a VPN tunnel which is, all my desktop traffic is encrypted between any location to the exit point in France, like my actual location is in Malaysia, but my virtual location is in France.  If I use  wget  in Fedora 30, all my data traffic will go through the encrypted VPN tunnel.  I set my Firefox virtual location as Switzerland which is then a Double Hop, which is an improvement as all the Firefox traffic is encrypted to the France exit point and then the encrypted traffic is redirected to the exit point in Switzerland.  The Double Hop speed is slower, but acceptable.  Again, many thanks to the Windscibe Canadian team for producing this needed high quality internet package for the World.One good feature is that the   windscribe-cli   reconnect to the last VPN exit point at every Fedora 30 shutdown and boot up cycle.  It remember the setup parameters and connect exactly every time.  Similarly, Firefox also reconnect to the last VPN exit point in every Close and Start cycle.  In one VPN add-on that I tried, it requires me to login every time when I Start Firefox to get their VPN service.  I remove the VPN add-on immediately and add-on Windscribe.  That was when I discovered Windscribe yesterday.  After a day or so, I found that Windscribe has all that I want in a VPN service exactly and more!  It comes with Privacy on top of Security.  Is save me a lot of trouble to search and do it myself to get only 10% at most what Windscribe already has.sudo dnf update   will automatically update what is new in the windscribe.repo   .   It is best that Windscribe put the windscribe packages in the Fedora repository as an open source.  This would gain the trust and confidence of all Fedora users to install the Windscribe packages as any one can look into them for improvements and check for malicious code.   NoScript has done it.     sudo dnf install mozilla-noscript   will install from the Fedora repository since the much earlier Fedora versions.  There is no need to include the extension  NoScript  from Add-ons  .  dnf  will automatically install   NoScript  from the Fedora repository and embed   NoScript  into Firefox.   sudo dnf update will automatically update any new changes in   NoScript  onto Firefox. Again, it is good that    dnf install windscribe-cli   will do all the work from the Fedora repository as only the Windscribe development team know the best to give users the seamless process.  If Windscribe do have such a plan, please investigate the negatives in doing so.  Like, many people can break the   windscribe-cli   if too many people are involved.  Perhaps, there should be an approval process such that any new changes in the Fedora repository must be reviewed and check by the Windscribe developer before any update, big or small, can be updated in the Fedora repository.If only the Windscribe client is running in Firefox, the WiFi icon  is normal on the Fedora 30.  If both the   windscribe-cli  is running in Fedora 30   and the Windscribe add-on is running in Firefox, the WiFi icon becomes a ? (question mark).  It is imperative that the WiFi icon on the desktop screen is back to normal and add with a new 'Key' icon on the desktop whenever the  windscribe-cli   is running in Fedora 30 as describe below.  The colour of the Windscribe icon in Firefox will show the browser client status.Test 1)Power down Router only and then power Router up.Test 2)Main power supply down.  Router is down, but the Laptop is running on battery power.In both Test 1 and Test 2, after desktop connection established, Firefox VPN reconnect again.However, the Laptop desktop VPN tunnel remains disconnected.  Users must run 'windscribe connect FR' to establish a VPN tunnel to a France exit point.It is imperative that a Fedora 30 desktop must have a Windscribe security icon, like a 'Key Symbol' at the top right corner of the desktop screen to tell users that the Desktop is either connected or disconnected to a VPN exit point.  Cisco IPsec-based VPN and SecurityKiss OpenVPN both have the 'Key Symbol' on the Fedora desktop screen whenever the VPN tunnel is connected.It is desirable to have the Desktop automatically re-connected to the last VPN exit point as soon as the Desktop establish connection to the Home Router, very much like Firefox automatically reconnect to the  browser last VPN exit point perpetually,  as users may forget to reconnect the Desktop.For both Test 1 an Test 2, Firefox could connect to a new exit point and not the previous exit point.  It is desirable that Firefox remember the last connected exit point and establish all new connections as such in manual mode.The above three inclusions will improve the VPN connectivity by a mile.--------3 days ago reviewDo as described as a VPN like my IP address is one in Germany when I selected the virtual location as Germany.  Although I did not checked using tools for the extra features like ad blocking, etc., I trust that Windscribe state it as it is.Another plus is that Windscribe did not guide, force, misled or use sinister ploy in getting users to do unnecessary or unwanted upgrade.So far my experience with Windscribe is satisfactory and smooth.  Hopefully this add-on will keep on improving and will not degrade in the future.  Then Windscribe will always have a place in my Firefox in every of my new Fedora about every six months.

It does a bunch of stuff. I love Windscribe and think it's a great option for a light-use VPN.That being said, it is just better to get the desktop version of the app instead. The only way I would justify choosing the extension over the desktop app would be if you were using a portable version of Firefox. Otherwise, get their desktop application.Secondly, I was having an issue where Firefox was starting up and then not loading my home page (www.google.com). At first I blamed it on uBlock, but then I did some debugging and found that this extension blocks the first page from loading when Firefox starts. My guess is it has something to do with either the extension refusing to initially load the page, or if Firefox doesn't want to load a page on startup until all extensions are loaded. Either way, I'd rather remove the extension than use a different browser. :(Edit: After reading further reviews, it has been made clear by Windscribe that they have only put priority on the Chrome extension and have not been updating this problem despite its being reported on their subreddit.Edit 7/7/19: While I'm not acquainted with the add-ons rollout system, I feel that three months does not qualify as soon.

I have been using this application a lot, specially to bypass some service limits for example those natural voice text to speech as you often, i only get a fixed amount of minutes for free.  If that happens 1 click on a button and not even 1 to 2 seconds later i can resume with what ever i was doing.  I basically do not use this application that much so the amount of free Gigs i get per month are well enough for me.  Most VPNs ask a lot of money, give you free but very limited use (like 1 IP), and often those servers are as SLOW A F..  as basically everyone that is using that application is using that 1 free IP address.  Not with Windscribe !!  Every IP i connect to is almost instantly connected and there is barely NO noticeable difference in my internet responsiveness.

This is my normal connection speed without Windscribe on and pinging the closest server to me. http://prntscr.com/n000byNow lets put this to the test with Windscribe  on again pinging the closest server to me. http://prntscr.com/n0021a Now i would not recommend using a WS server that is on the other side of the world for gaming as you will see my ping is high and my upload speed is low.. I had a small loss of around 4 to 7 Mbps on download speed. I actually wanted to do 1 more test that to the same server as before but with a relay via France with WS.   Damn speed tester failed twice due to a firewall error.  ? Not the problem of WS but the speed tester. Ill stop it here as i am flying through my WS Gigs like a stoned hippy xD   But overall i am very very satisfied with the amount of data you get monthly from WS for free and also the amount of quality.  I experience almost NO loss on speed on download at all does not matter what server i connect to.  Though i do lose almost all of my upload data.  But some other VPNs i tried disabled you internet for some time or required you to restart the pc. They where very limited and or cost a lot of money.  Windscribe basically gives me TOP quality for free and enough Gigs to chew on. Before i run out i will be topped up with the next month free data.   There is absolutely NO other VPN that i have seen so far that gives me this much data and quality and 0% headaches installing and using it.  Switching IPs is child's play with one click of a button. And my internet stays connected 100% of the time without any outages whatsoever  !!!   i will even go so far to saw that i can completely not understand at all that there are people out there giving this application a lesser score then 5 stars. I seriously can not rap my head around it. Those people must probably never have used any other VPN AT ALL.  Because other VPNs i used that where free are nothing more then a pain in the ass, long installments, and often blackouts meaning my internet connection would drop every so many minutes for a couple of seconds as the server crashed and i had to wait before it connected again.  If you see the Windscribe VPN ! Just stop looking further guys because these people give you so much quality, there is basically no other free VPN that will top this.

This VPN apparently only showed up in 2017 also, but from what I've read there is a plan to eventually implement the IPV6. Between the plugin and the Windows program, the IPLeak site seems to pull up alternate credentials for the IPV4, so I must assume everything works as it should. The program also allows you to tell it of an alternate web or socks5 proxy if you use something separate to send your connections through outside of the VPN itself. After first installing the program, I did have issues with the adapter disconnecting, but not able to connect back. I had to disable the adapter for Windscribe and then re-enable it in Networks and Sharing to get it to work right and I haven't had issues since.

Bitte lasst das oder macht es als Option für diejenigen die es wollen. Da ich Amazon viel Nutzer bin (aus verschiedensten Gründen) nervt diese aufgezwungene Info ungemein und es hat schon ein bisschen den Anflug von Kindergarten.Bisher lese ich hier von anderen Nutzern auch nur negatives darüber. Wenn ach so viele positive Nachrichten bei Ihnen darüber eingegangen wären, so hätte der ein oder andere sicher hier auch ein positives Feedback dazu hinterlassen. So kann man die App niemanden empfehlen! Bitte dringend nachbessern!Grüße', 'Positiv:+ Die Punkteübersicht ist viel detaillierter als auf der Webseite. Die Fristen für gesperrte Punkte werden bei PIA angezeigt.+ Wenn man Partnerseiten aufruft, wird man bei aktiviertem Punkte-Sammel-Alarm automatisch über einen Layer benachrichtigt mit dem aktuellen Punktekurs.Negativ:- Bei PIA muss man jedes Mal die Logindaten eingeben. Über den Browser in Verbindung mit dem Passwort-Manager geht das schneller.- Obwohl man sich bei PIA eingeloggt hat, führt jeder Link zur normalen Webseite, wo man sich erneut anmelden muss.- Im Tab ""Einstellungen"" wird im angemeldeten Zustand ein ""Ausloggen""-Link angezeigt. Es reicht, den Browser zu beenden, da sich PIA eh nichts merken kann.- Apropos merken: Der Tab ""Meine Shops"" wird nach jedem Browser-Neustart auf die Standard-Auswahl zurückgesetzt – egal ob bei PIA angemeldet oder nicht. Aktuell ein überflüssiger Tab.- Der Tab ""eCoupons"" sieht immer gleich aus – egal, ob man bei PIA angemeldet ist oder nicht. Ist man nicht angemeldet, reagieren die Links nicht mal.- Bei eBay Kleinanzeigen taucht der Punkte-Sammel-Alarm auch auf, was keinen Sinn macht.- Manchmal wird der PSA im falschen Tab eingeblendet. Gerade gesehen bei Facebook, obwohl die Crumpler-Website im anderen Tab ist (ohne PSA).- Bei Amazon nervt der PSA allmählich. Nicht alles ist bei eBay selbst mit Payback-Punkten günstiger oder gar zu finden! Die gesamte Anti-Amazon-Kampagne seit Ende Juni wirkt kindisch und unprofessionell. Als hätte Mama Amazon seinem Kind den Lolly weggenommen. Und deshalb ist jetzt Payback!Bis jetzt ist PIA nicht mehr als eine Bookmarksammlung. Für Punktejunkies, die auf die Freigabe ihrer gesperrten Punkte warten, wäre PIA eine befriedigende Ergänzung. PIA wurde übereilt released, eigentlich ist das eine BETA. Und weil ich kein Freund von Betas bin, werde ich PIA wieder deinstallieren, wenn sich in einigen Wochen nichts deutlich verbessert. Payback funktioniert auch sehr gut ohne PIA.P.S.: Ich benutze Mac OS X 10.6.8 und stets die aktuelle Firefox-Version.Nachtrag 02.12.2014: Der Alarm funktioniert auch bei ebay.de nicht mehr. Amazon halte ich eher für eine Ausrede. Nervt nicht wirklich, wirkt aber immer noch subtil kindisch. Kommt ihr mit dem Update voran?', 'Jetzt geht auch das Add Ons !', 'Ich habe mir diese Erweiterung geholt, damit ich nicht vergesse Punkte zu sammeln, wenn ich eh bei einem Partnerunternehmen online einkaufe. Aber bei jedem Aufruf von amazon.de kommen so blöde Meldungen wie ""Wieso bei amazon shoppen wenn es bei 25 Shops 10fach Punkte gibt?!"" - DAS NERVT!Bitte dringend überarbeiten - Die Einblendung bei Partnershops ist gewünscht, anderswo sollte die Erweiterung sich aber still verhalten.Zu Ihrer Antwort: Man könnte es ja abschaltbar machen. Punktealaerm aktivieren: [X] auf Partnerseiten, [_] auf anderen Seiten', 'Dieses Tool hat mir echt gefehlt. Ich empfinde es als sehr nützlich, da ich sehr häufig vergesse, über die Payback-Seite einen Onlineshop zu besuchen. Im Offline-Geschäft wird man ja immer nach seiner Karte gefragt, online leider nicht. Teilweise kenne ich die Partner auch gar nicht.Als Negativ empfinde ich, dass es bei einigen Partnern einfach nicht klappt, so poppt z.B. bei Ernstings Family ständig (alle halbe Minute) eine Fehlermeldung auf und im Payback-Symbol erscheint ein Ausrufezeichen.Was mich aber viel mehr nervt ist, dass ich mich fast jedes 2. Mal komplett neu einloggen muss, um Punkte zu sammeln, d.h. ich muss wieder meine Karte raus kramen, die Nummer eingeben, Geburtsdatum, PLZ. Ich werde das noch eine Weile beobachten. Wenn sich das nicht ändern, fliegt das Tool wieder runter, auch wenn ich es echt toll finde. Aber die Negativpunkt nerven einfach gewaltig.@Entwickler: Tolle Idee, aber bitte nachbessern!']",PIA – der offizielle PAYBACK Internet Assistent - ist ein Muss für jeden Online Shopper. Die clevere Browser-Erweiterung erleichtert das Online Punkte sammeln mit PAYBACK.

DO NOT USE YUBIKEY FOR TWO  FACTOR AUTHENTICATION - UNFORTUNATELY LASTPASS DOES NOT USE FIDO2 AS THE AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM AND INSTEAD USES THE YUBIKEY PSEUDORANDOM KEY GENERATOR THAT BECAUSE OF POOR IMPLEMENTATION BY LASTPASS MEANS IT REMAINS SUSEPTIBLE TO ATTACK AND LEAVES YOUR ENTIRE VAULT OPEN TO THIEVES. THIS IS A KNOWN SECURITY ISSUE AND IRONICALLY ONLY APPLIES TO PAYING CUSTOMERS. SINCE LASTPASS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THIS ISSUE, NO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN MADE. THIS TOGETHER WITH A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THEIR ISSUE MANAGEMENT RATES THIS AS 3 STARS AT BEST. THE remainder of the review relates to usability and is based on Lastpass\'s own publicity which given some of their representations at the time of this review regarding Yubikey being false, should be taken with that fact in mind. Lastpass is probably one of the more intuitive password managers on the market at the time of writing with integration into the widest number of websites and available on the widest number of platforms of all the consumer focussed password / identity management solutions. Security applications have for the most part been devoid of interfaces that make it simple for the end-user to use, or for the most part even understand, so in many ways LastPass\'s user interface is the main reason for its awards and subsequent user base. Functionally the range of features that come with Lastpass are impressive, if a little daunting for someone who has not seen its evolution as a piece of software and it can feel as though if you used all the features and functionality it contains – it can be used to keep secure notes and has multiple templates for recording other types of sensitive data besides passwords for websites – then you would be relying on a basket that would be holding a lot of heavy eggs. Templates include SSNs, WiFi Passwords, Bank accounts, payment cards, Insurance Details etc. and has the funtionality for creating your own templates (I created one for storing GPG Keys and another phone IMEIs among other things), that it really can feel that you could be left very exposed to identity theft if an exploitable security hole went unpatched. There is, as with all password managers, an issue that is core to single password information vaults. Your LastPass password may the the last password you\'ll ever need but it\'s also the only password you must never ever forget. Or divulge. And it needs to be good enough that it\'s not easily guessable.  For all these reasons I believe it\'s critical that some form of two factor authentication is used in addition to a strong password. The second authenticator can be hardware, e.g. software like Google Authenticator which generates a pseudo-random number generator app creates a new 6 digit authorisation code every 30 seconds. (Lastpass offer their own app for generating these numbers). It\'s why we all should have at least two front door keys (and not keep one under the flowerpot!) However the Achilles heel that all Vault based security apps struggle with: To ensure that only you can access your data also means that as there is no means of opening the vault if you forget your LastPass password, or lose the only source of authenticating you as the authorised user. LastPass have attempted to resolve this problem with a form of escrow that grants user nominated individuals access to the Vault in the event that the primary user is unable to input their password. I understand it is there primarily to help the family in circumstances where they need to take over management of the user\'s affairs. but the solution has a ""tacked on"" feel to it. Lastpass has made a strong commitment to ensuring their offering is secure which can be found on their website. Of all the password managers on the market I have found it to be the best and rate it highly, recommending it frequently. That said there are parts of the functionality which novice users and those who aren\'t IT literate do find it frustrating to use. I do think perseverence in learning is rewarded - there are substantial set of FAQs, active user forums, instructional videos, user support and guides which can be easily accessed.  Overall a very useful and powerful extension which provides a huge amount of tools to make your online life far more secure.', ""I've been using LastPass for years now on all browsers and haven't had any problems.

From the research that I\'ve done LastPass is a good option...the best that I\'ve found.Usability: LastPass is frustrating!! It doesn\'t do anything very well. When creating a new account it\'s weak. In my experience, most of the time it doesn\'t even ""see"" that you\'re singing up for a new account, so I have decided to open the LastPass Vault, click on the + (plus symbol) and create the account step-by-step. Even doing this is somewhat frustrating: right-clicking in the password field to generate a password forces you to mouse to the bottom of that dialog, click Generate Password and then mouse down to select Generate Password and then select your options.MANY times I relied on LastPass to know that I am signing up for a new account and have regretted it because it either doesn\'t see/know what I\'ve input into any of the fields and/or I have to go back to the site and select ""Forgot Password"" or whatever because LastPass effed up! Makes you feel like an idiot.After LastPass has the correct user name(s) and password(s) in its database it still doesn\'t work most of the time for me. For example, I open a site and the logon dialog appears. My wife has one account and I have another account. LastPass often won\'t even recognize the site (the same URL that is in its database including what\'s after the slash, e.g. https://www.xyz.com/login).Often LastPass will post and indicate that it recognizes the page you\'ve loaded. I guess, you\'re supposed to be able to click on the LastPass icon and the login options are supposed to post (e..g. my wife\'s credentials and my credentials) and then click on one and it will enter your credentials. Most of the time I have to open the LastPass Vault and copy and paste the information  back onto the login page.Trying to login to leave this review took four times, i.e. my wife\'s credentials posted and my credentials posted. I selected my credentials three times and LastPass never entered them. I opened the vault and copy and pasted my user name and password.Conclusion: if LastPass is as secure as the reviews I\'ve read it\'s worth the frustration. But it would sure be convenient if LastPass actually worked as advertised on my devices (x3).', 'Klass', ""Unusable. Firefox 57 - LastPass main menu opens 2/3 cut off the right side of my screen.

In chrome, it's better.Problems: - Lastpass uses it's own heuristics to find and annotate login fields.  This heuristic is pretty good, but it's not as good as the built-in Firefox password manager; it regularly fills in usernames (and sometimes even passwords) in inappropriate form fields.  Also, the grey-star last-pass indicator interferes with (very) few sites because it's an actually addition to the page content, and dropdown it generates conflicts with site dropdown occasionally.  The core problem here is that it's just doing too much, and *when* it breaks a form, there's no clue that disabling lastpass temporarily is a workaround - you need to guess that.  And temporarily disabling it is not a nice experience since it requires a browser reboot. - Lastpass interacts with forms, particularly including invisible form fields, causing minor (but nasty) data corruption in e.g. Jenkins (a common dev tool website) configuration screens.  It took our dev team quite a lot of swearing until we figured out that it was lastpass that kept reverting config values to previously seen values silently whenever a lastpass user edited the screen.  Since then, I've noticed several other suspicious instances where it appears that lastpass edits form fields causing websites to apparently malfunction. - Lastpass is slow; it materially contributes to each and every page load time, particularly to otherwise fast sites.  The chrome extension does not appear to suffer from this problem, and the magnitude probably depends on the complexity of the page loaded - but it's enough to contribute to the feeling that Firefox is slower than chrome. - Lastpass causes multi-second hangups and generally doesn't work well with the new multi-process firefox (e10s).  There's no warning nor hint this is due to lastpass; firefox just becomes much less responsive. - Security: Lastpass is an online, centralized platform.  There have been several breaches in the past (though since your data is encrypted, that doesn't automatically spell disaster); and there have been criticisms of how the plugin communicates with the central server.  Account recovery is a feature - but a risk, and it's on by default (if a hacker every penetrates any of your systems and can read incoming email, he can likely recover your lastpass acount).  These aren't major issues since they don't sound likely to affect many people - but the point is that security is not easy to get right, and lastpass is clearly not immune to making mistakes - and as a centralized system, that's a problem. The rounds of PBKDF2 are fairly low, if likely not an issue (in short: picking a master password from the dictionary isn't safe).For me, the dealbreaker isn't any particular problem - I'm OK with disabling multi-process (e10s) for a while; the performance problem was noticable, but only just barely (though the constant tiny slowdown is grating after a while) so I could live with that; The form-field shenanigans are nasty, but if you know about them, then on the occasional failure it's easy enough to try and disable lastpass (much like some sites won't work with an adblocker); and occasionally misfiring autofill heuristics are only occasionally annoying (and disablable); the security issues are real, but pretty unlikely to hit you.The problem is that the whole picture is one of resounding mediocrity.I'm going to give keyfox a shot.  Setting it up is not as user friendly, but so far it looks to work (no quirky UI overlays that mess up sites, no perf troubles so far, works with e10s, not centralized)."", ""So glad to see mkdante381's review. After struggling with the inability to even sign in to LastPass on Firefox desktop 44.0b1,2 and 4 (worked fine on my Android pad and phone and the online vault, thankfully) and working with LastPass support who were quite nice but steered me only to two sets of FAQs to try to solve the problem (all of which I had already tried), the last response from support was to completely uninstall and reinstall Firefox, which I was  not convinced would solve the issue. I was aware I had the Multi-Process Firefox Test installed but had seen no bad conflict reviews from anyone. Now I think I will be patient and see if the issue solves itself when the test ends.

You should grab the latest from LP's website: https://lastpass.com/download"", 'I have use LastPass for both Opera 12.17 and Firefox 38. To date, after eight months of daily use, I have not had a single problem. A rough estimate of the number of sites that I have stored in LastPass with login information is close to 100 separate addresses. One of the options in LastPass is to disable the ""unsafe password manager in Firefox."" I never would have known that Firefox had a problem with their built-in password manager if I had not installed LastPass.Computer security experts recommend that you change your password at least every month and to use ones that are hard to guess or crack. LastPass has an advanced password generator that allows you to do that. Every time you generate a new password, it stores it for later use. If you have an existing site listed in LastPass, it will ask you if you want to replace the existing password or to create a new site (or replace the existing site). The hardest passwords to crack are the ones that have the most characters and that use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.It has a number of features that I particularly like, such as multi-factor authentication, the ability to auto fill or auto login into a site, or choose among different logins and for the same site (such as PayPal).It has a credit monitoring feature that alerts you any time one of the three credit agencies is contacted or makes a change to your account. The reason it is included in a password manager is to alert you in case someone has hacked into an account where your money or identity is at stake.You can organize your sites into separate folders, such as charge cards, medical, shopping, or whatever name you give it (or example, online news sites). If you should happen to use the same password on two sides you will be alerted.If you have a site for which you do not want to be automatically logged in (such as PayPal where you might have more than one user), you can use its right-click context menu to fill in just the specific information you need, such as a password, username, e-mail address, or telephone number.The fact that all your passwords are stored in a central location means that you can access them from any computer provided that you take appropriate precautions when accessing it. You can also set up separate identities that are subsets of your main list of sites. The benefit here is that you can set up an identity to store only sites that require a username and password and do not store any sensitive information, or if they do, you\'re not required to use your actual personal information.Other things that you can store beyond the websites, are what are called ""secure notes"" that are basically text files like Notepad that become a permanent part of your site listings. You also have the ability to export and import site settings from another computer, which makes the job of transporting the information from an old computer to a new computer a lot easier.Sometimes a useful feature can be a hassle when it is set to be activated automatically -- such as the auto login or auto fill. Because many sites will have both their login screen and register screen in the same location, LastPass cannot distinguish between two entries with the same name. For example, on the left side of the webpage it may say ""existing users login"" while on the right side of the same page it may say ""new users register here"" and you will notice that both sides have entries for username and password. If your site is set up for auto fill and or auto login, everywhere it says ""username"" and ""password"" will subsequently be filled in with whatever you have stored in LastPass. This is why you may want to turn off the auto fill/auto login features for a site, and then manually enter them. By ""manually"" I mean (A.) put your cursor inside the box, right-click your mouse (or touchpad), and select from the right-click context menu one of the following: auto fill (which will fill in the information automatically), copy username (then paste the copied value into the box using either Ctrl-V or right-click, ""Paste.""), and/or copy password (doing the same copy and paste routine as you did for the username).Usually, clicking the auto fill choice in the right-click context menu will do the job. If you have multiple listings for the same site, when you initially put your cursor inside a box and right-click, you will first get a choice of which user listing to copy from. Because many sites use JavaScript entry boxes, the right-click context menu will not work. In those cases, you can get the username and password information directly from the LastPass icon.Speaking of icons, under the options category on the main menu, you can choose a different set of icons for when LastPass is active or not active. You can set an option for having the LastPass vault open up automatically in a separate tab. At the top of that vault listing, as well as clicking on the LastPass icon, you\'ll see a search box in which all you need to do is to type a few characters of the website you wish to visit and it will give you the listing or listings it has stored. Therefore, it\'s a timesaver and that you do not have to go looking for an entry in a separate folder.Of course, the most useful feature is the auto fill auto login option that kicks into gear as soon as the website opens (or after a user specified delay) so that you\'re ready to do whatever business you need to do (such as paying your monthly bills).One last feature I want to mention is one called ""Security Check"" -- here you can have LastPass evaluate the security of all of the websites you have listed along with their passwords, and get a percentage score indicating how secure they are. You will also get a percentage security rating and a number of suggested improvements to the sites you have stored that will be listed in descending order of security rating from highest to lowest.In addition to the most common entries that you will need to fill out for virtually every website requiring a username and password is a section where you can put in your own keywords and values associated with those keywords. For example, if you are filling out job applications, you can put in such fields as Prior Occupation, Supervisor, Name of Company, and so forth.Since LastPass is set up to handle the majority of websites that use the most common terms for entry into that website, you will run across variations in how they list their entry for a Username. For example, it may say ""Email"" instead of ""E-Mail Address,"" or instead of ""Username"" (one word), it will say ""User Name"" (two words). Unfortunately, LastPass cannot handle these variations on a theme. This is where you would copy and paste the Username that is listed in the site information stored on LastPass.I rate this five stars because it is a must-have add-on. Although there are other password managers on the market, I go by the philosophy, ""if it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it."" Or in the case of add-ons, if the one you chose can perform 90% of what you need it to do, you will be wasting your time trying to find one that will give you 95% of what you need -- or even 100%, because some of the strengths with LastPass outweigh whatever shortcomings it may have.', 'This is a phenomenal password app. Saves all your site passwords, autologins in as soon as you navigate there (if you want it too), and protects all of your passwords behind one master password.', ""As far as their sales literature says it supports Seamonkey.As far as the program and their support say it does not.While it seems to work on most other things it does not work on the email client other than to REMOVE all you login passwords.This is bad.Avoid if you don't want to manually enter your email passwords every session."", ""It's almost great!

They are unguessable and would take a brute force attack (which is where someone tries every single combination of characters) years even with the best super computers. I can do this now with Lastpass. It creates the passwords, it stores them, it then populates them automatically when I next need them and best of all my vault is so incredibly safe.I don't have to remember anything! Only one passphrase (access to my lastpass account) which is then protected by a 2nd level of security - one time passwords adminstered via a physical USB device known as a Yubikey. without this device no one can access my account. But even with this device you still need to know my passphrase. And of course, even if someone did observe the password issued by the Yubikey, it is only valid for 30 seconds and then a new password is created. For anyone to be able to adhere to BEST practice password standards and security you need tools. Tools that make it easy so you don't have to remember complicated passwords. In fact with Lastpass you only have to recall 1 password, with that password I can access my vaule of 300+ passwords. I can add to the vault and update it as I go about my normal online experience. Best of all its incredibly safe, I chose to go one step further and get a Yubikey and 2 factor authentification. If you don't want that expense then Lastpass offers the same high standards via Free options.In fact, Lastpass is FREE!!! Many password applications are over $50US. I used lastpass for a year with a free account before upgrading to their premium account, which is only a $1 per month.

Why? because lastpass admitted that they have gotten hacked very recently.Don't listen to these individuals obviously working for lastpass, store your passwords in your own computers or write them down, safest place they can be.

Some just like to keep their data on their own servers.  Some just want the flexibility to choose their software and their hosting provider separately.  Some have tight corporate IT restrictions on what they can store on other servers or what sites they can access.  They are all valid reasons for potential customers to not want to use your servers whether you think so or not.As for Weave you can run your own Weave server if you want.

But the fact is, I\'m the one who sets up all of the accounts and passwords on my wife\'s laptop and mine and I use the same info on both, since the purchases are made from the same bank account and are sent to the same address!Negative: I don\'t like the idea of sending all of my data to any one server.  Users these days spend a lot of extra time finding apps that won\'t do that.  And let\'s face it, if someone can write your security software for your servers, then someone can hack it and since you advertise that you have all of our data in one place, you\'re a target for hackers and it happens all the time!The thing is, we don\'t know what can happen with it once all of it leaves our computers and goes to someone elses, lock, stock and barrel and that is quite different than a company\'s server being hacked and only losing one piece of our info, for that one web site.And to address the comment about your company being sold one day, if a company does buy this one, while they may not be eager to harm what the company does, there are a lot of stupid people who buy companies and radically change things and hose it all up.  Or they are the type that thinks something new is automatically better and try it and there goes our security!And the developer said that if this happened, it would be closely watched.  BY WHOM???  YOU\'RE GONE!!!  And the truth is, you\'re not going to announce it before hand so we can jump ship, because that would be a condition of the sale and it would hurt your chances of selling the company to someone anyway.  And yes, it would require an update to change the security on us, but so what?  They\'d offer it as an enhancement and so, we\'d think it was an improvement, not knowing what has changed and just download it and then its too late!  After all, they wouldn\'t tell us it\'s going to be bad for us. :)Negative: I don\'t see where this app has the ability to store and pull up receipts and to a pinhead like me who is constantly trying to remember who I bought something from and when, this is a nice feature, especially since I can never find my paper receipts either! :)So anyway, that\'s my take on it and I think, or at least I hope, that it sums up what people are going to great lengths to try to say to other users and to the developers.  And both sides can argue with these points, but they are facts.  They may not happen, but yes, they could, no matter how good one thinks their security is.So I hope this helped to sum up what folks are saying.  I also think that it doesn\'t make sense for any users to go off all crazy about ""what a scam"" it is, etc..  If they are telling you what they\'re doing, then by definition, it cannot be a scam. :)  You have a choice.  You are informed.And for the developers, I don\'t think it makes sense to keep talking about your security being so great, because your type of security has been hacked before and will be again and you are a target spot, since your software is known to collect all of a users info, so it\'s like one stop shopping for hackers!  I\'m not blaming you for that.  I\'m just saying that realistically, if someone can write the software that secures you, then that means that there\'s also someone who can hack it!  And so, unless your security was written by God, you are not truly secure! :)', 'fantastic!', 'wreaks havoc in your toolbar settings!lastpass,this add-on has always been one of my must-haves but then lately it causes conflicts with my toolbar settings!everytime i restart firefox, all my other add-ons buttons (e.g. read it later,speed dial, personal menu) are missing except for the lastpass compact toolbar button!!its like its been PERSISTING to stay beside the searchbar instead of just being OBEDIENT and STAY in the personal toolbar like i wanted to!its my DECISION to put it in the personal/bookmarks bar and lastpass should RESPECT that.yes its SMART, but it should not act like its got a mind of its own and push all other buttons out of the way because that would be so DUMB!i suggest that lastpass compact button should be in the customize window (like every other add-ons) so we USERS will FREELY decide exactly where it should stay.another thing: pls make a toggle button for the lastpass sites sidebar like the rest of respectable firefox add-ons.thanks and pls improve!', 'wreaks havoc in your toolbar settings!lastpass,this add-on has always been one of my must-haves but then lately it causes conflicts with my toolbar settings!everytime i restart firefox, all my other add-ons buttons (e.g. read it later,speed dial, personal menu) are missing except for the lastpass compact toolbar button!!its like its been PERSISTING to stay beside the searchbar instead of just being OBEDIENT and STAY in the personal toolbar like i wanted to!its my DECISION to put it in the personal/bookmarks bar and lastpass should RESPECT that.yes its SMART, but it should not act like its got a mind of its own and push all other buttons out of the way because that would be so DUMB!i suggest that lastpass compact button should be in the customize window (like every other add-ons) so we USERS will FREELY decide exactly where it should stay.another thing: pls make a toggle button for the lastpass sites sidebar like the rest of respectable firefox add-ons.thanks and pls improve!', 'lastpass,this add-on has always been one of my must-haves but then lately it causes conflicts with my toolbar settings!everytime i restart firefox, all my other add-ons buttons (e.g. read it later,speed dial, personal menu) are missing except for the lastpass compact toolbar button!!its like its been PERSISTING to stay beside the searchbar instead of just being OBEDIENT and STAY in the personal toolbar like i wanted to!its my DECISION to put it in the personal/bookmarks bar and lastpass should RESPECT that.yes its SMART, but it should not act like its got a mind of its own and push all other buttons out of the way because that would be so DUMB!i suggest that lastpass compact button should be in the customize window (like every other add-ons) so we USERS will FREELY decide exactly where it should stay.another thing: pls make a toggle button for the lastpass sites sidebar like the rest of respectable firefox add-ons.thanks and pls improve!', 'Most useful extension I have right now.', 'This is a major ripoff!!!

The Privacy Statement mentions that the software will not send unencrypted information to Lastpass servers.  In my opinion, in order to be seriously considered as a password management service provider, the developer needs to: (i) explicitly mention what personal customer information is available to Lastpass, its contractor, and/or potential hijackers of their servers; (ii) verify their statement through at least one reputable software audit firm; (iii) do (i) and (ii) for each version provided to customers.2.

Nothing or very little to protect the potential users of the service from LastPass and/or their contractors (rogue employee) or the effects of potential hijack of the service.  Given the type of service provided, the Terms of Service should be very explicit to: (i) what information is Lastpass storing and in what format/standard; (ii) what is the service essentially provided by Lastpass (e.g.: ""Lastpass will only store your passwords in an encrypted format to which only you have the key.  The perfomance of this service and the information available to Lastpass or its contractors are verified by YYY and traceable to ZZZ, etc.""; (iii) Lastpass provides IDtheft insurance up to $$$$.; (iv) once a user abandons the service, the removal of their information is certifiable by third parties.', ""I really like this addon.

This is simply not true; as far as i know, the stored passwords are protected by encryption, and this code is released by Mozilla to trusted individuals for specific purposes... such as creating an extension.  However, there are appz out there that can attack/crack your stored passwords and tell you what they are if you ""lose"" your master password -- but really these are illegitimate programs.

Doing this for every site is not possible... Enter LastPassThis extensions lets user create the STRONGEST, \'unbreakable\' passwords, and manages them tightly... No one, even yourself has to know ANY of your passwords, just one master one (and you better make that one strong) and your login details are sent encyrpted, then sent over SSL (Double Encrypted).  they are held remotely in an encypted form, so even if someone hacked their servers...

Or perhaps a far better solution would be one library which is part of the Firefox core which handles the sending of such data to these servies. We would need to be able to tell firefox to never let a certain extension call home, except via it\'s api for that library.Until such a day, I quite reasonably can not trust such apps and neither should anybody else. However I will use it to store logins to non important sites that I want to be able to access from anywhere.However, aside from the trust/security problems with the extension, technically it is perfect and is everything I have ever dreamed of in an online password manager. It works just like the Firefox default manager, except it\'s stored online. You guys are legends for pulling this off!!!===end of review but I continue with a more detailed report of the entire setup of the service on my pc, including the install and config of this extension==However while the final product is perfect, the install process and initial configuration is scary as %#$@. They get me to download an exe from their site when I could have just used this xpi!!! They then talk about removing my passwords from my computer and disabling the Firefox manager!!! Regardless I made a backup of everything as it was apparent they would try to do things without my permission.https://lastpass.com/faq.php#whynotbuiltinAfter reading this I was keen to see if they in fact could do as they say... but no, they asked for my master password, to which of course I hit cancel and then cancel again when it asked a second time. They then tell me that they can\'t find anything... HA! Stupid assuming FAQ entry!!! I was hoping that because I had not given them access to the passwords, they would not do anything stupid like disable it anyway or delete the file, but their phrasing in the dialog boxes wasn\'t at all comforting. Thankfully they left everything as is because I did not give them this password, however I then had to install this extension which for some reason was not added after the initial install (which now knowing about this extension, I wish I had never run).I install the extension and they yet again ask to grab all my passwords from firefox and I say ""no"" yet again. Then I go to a simple site that I don\'t mind giving away the password for. The default FF master password box pops up as there is a login form. I enter it and it auto fills my the login details like norm. However as soon as I submit the for that\'s when Last Pass kicks back into action... it comes up with a branded version of the ""Save this password?"" bar that firefox normally uses and allows me to save the password to their service. Perfect!!! I love this, it\'s great!!!Once set up using the method I described (starting at the xpi, not the exe) this should be a great way of keeping everything backed up on your own pc, but at the same time, making it accessible via their online service. Also it means that they are never actually reading from your password manager, so you don\'t have to trust that they won\'t automatically send everything to their server and won\'t go and delete everything either. This is how it should be, I want them to see what I want them to see, not everything like they are trying to do. Also why the hell should the password be deleted from my system? That is a big mistake!!! What if their company goes bust and they can\'t afford to keep everything running. There go all my passwords in one go because they deleted them from my system and now can\'t afford to keep the servers running so I can get my stuff back. Or it could be a fire or flood or data corruption or anything. This is my data, so they shouldn\'t be auto deleting it!But yeah if you follow my setup path and only use it to store non critical passwords until they fix the trust issue I mentioned, then you should be fine and this should be quite a useful extension.', 'The first free tool that is really is comparable to Roboform in functionality!

It also does so with the minimum necessary permissions, which in an age of spying browser addons is something to appreciate.Firefox keeps some internal info about which tabs are 'children' of 'parent' tabs, and depending whether you have clicked around in the tab bar or not, may choose to activate some 'peer' of the closing tab rather than one adjacent to the closing tab. But this information is not communicated to the user at all, the tab bar appears to be just a list of tabs! I'm fairly technically literate and I find this behaviour stunningly confusing, I can only imagine how frustrating this must be to less technical users. I'm not even sure that this description of how it works is 100% right, and I've spent some time looking into it!In my opinion, Firefox's closing order for tabs without parent-child relationships (selecting the tab to the right) is also wrong. When you open a new tab, it is opened on the right. It only makes sense that closing a tab would select the tab to the left, taking you back toward where you began. The fault doesn't lie entirely with Firefox though, this is also Chrome's behaviour, and the Firefox team must feel much pressure to keep their interface consistent with the competition to make switching easy.But I digress. These are small user interface issues, but minor details like this can have major impact on the user experience. Kudos to the author for making this extension.The only flaw is that, when configured to select the tab to the left, there is a brief flash where the tab to the right is selected before switching to the tab to the left. I presume that this is due to a limitation of the current extension API, where the extension reacts to the tab closed event after the tab is gone and Firefox has already made its default next tab selection, and that nothing can be done to fix it. Unfortunate, but not a deal breaker!Users who care about tab opening behaviour are also encouraged to check out an about:config option added in Firefox 60, which positions new tabs to the right of the opening tab (instead of to the right of the current peer tabs, or at the end of the tab strip entirely):browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrent = true"", 'None of these add-ons works without activating the right tab when the active tab is closed.

(I have updated it to the newest version, but I don\'t see any visible changes yet).1 Problem: If I check ""...automatic login"" in Options, when I close  (log off) a page, as it returns to the login page, Kee keeps login again... I had to uncheck the (convenient BTW) option box and manually do login. What can it be done to fix this?2 Problem fixed: I was seen in some secundary pages the Kee icon in some places it shouldn\'t be (I guess Kee was seen that as login/pwd) and even in a particular page the whole thing started to blink o tremble in a way I couldn\'t do nothing to stop it. I solved the problem opening and editing the connection login and in the last ""Kee"" tab, in URLs set as ""Exact: The Url must match exactly including full path and query string"" and then, in the additional frame I added the exact url of the main page (where the real login/pwd is). After doing this (and save the change!)

Overall it's a nifty addon but buggy, for instance I have it installed yet the addons page says I don't... unfortunately passIFox got abandoned so there are not a lot of alternatives.Reply: well, if you're about to or already did rewrite the code then the argument is valid. I would have expected a bit more. My internet banking page for instance uses a sensitive frame to login, if that frame is not submitted properly the whole process fails, but KeeFox does not understand to look inside the frames of pages for fields, even with different sub-domains, it just covers the top page. PassIFox managed that, but now I'm off Chrome, on to the e10s FX and it's not compatible. Also by poor coding I mean you focus on other things like browsing the db instead of first making sure your addon covers all scenarios for filling fields and then do other things once the main function is working fully. Luckily I can use autocomplete, but what's the point of the addon then? And there are a lot of other pages, top documents, on which it doesn't want to autocomplete... not even to list logins in the right click menu.

KeePass allows me to segregate passwords into individual databases that I can control sharing contexts. KeeFox then allows me to access all of the open databases simultaneously.Now on to the shortcomings and caveats:The UI integration could be just a bit better. For example, I'd like to see a LastPass-ish type context menu on login fields offering logins for the same or similar URLs. Same goes for an option to manually save fields on the page.Also, there is apparently some issue with saving/filling JavaScript forms. The end result is that KeeFox isn't as reliable as LastPass in detecting and filling forms. The developer has mentioned in the forums the technical hurdles to this, which seem to boil down to concerns about improperly filling a form. I'd prefer if an option were offered to at least attempt to fill JavaScript forms without a submit action.Lastly (and this isn't really KeeFox's fault), if you have tried out PassIFox, remove it. PassIFox disables the built-in Firefox password manager. Disabling this intereferes with Firefox's built-in Sync, and also with KeeFox's KeePass authorization key storage. KeeFox will properly turn off the built-in password manager in a manner that allows both Sync and KeeFox to work correctly."", 'Great Work - I Just wish it could become discrete and like a small button (Like Lastpass) and not occupy a whole toolbar area.

So far i see its potential and really want to love it but theres just somethings about it i see need to be added to be a true LastPass replacement, and those are:-A way to make it work without having KeePass constantly open. Nowhere does KeeFox's documentation say KeePass needs to be open too for the addon to work, and it took me ages to realize thats whats needed to make use of this. If possible if it could work with KeePass not being opened too itd be better.-A narrow toolbar that only appears when asking you what login details you want to use on a site (for times when you have more that just one account on a site) similar to the one of LastPass, that and the ability to set which one should it fill in by default. Currently the only way to currently do this is to have the toolbar or icon of KeeFox always viewable.-Ability to detect what databases KeePass currently has. So far (not sure if bug possibly) KeeFox will list old databases that dont exist and theres no way to remove them from the list at all. Not even if you uninstall Keepass and KeeFox.-Since KeeFox can detect when theres a login field it should have in the context menu an option to generate a secure password from there (but to be only available in Firefox's context menu when a login field is detected and not constantly there)-On some sites it fills in the username but not the password, however Lastpass can somehow, for example on redtube it will fill out the username but not the password, perhaps it has something to do with sites not allowing a password to autocomplete? (by default Lastpass has a setting that prevents sites from doing that so that it can still fill in the password)Aside from those issues, this is a top notch addon, seriously i cannot believe  this isnt integrated into and part of KeePass as most passwords are used on websites and the current way that KeePass works with browsers makes most people not want to use a password manager in the first place lol."", 'Never a problem on each Platoform/OS I use: Firefox on Windows in two different places and Android on different phones!

A smaller footprint on Firefox's interface: A full menu bar is used for three buttons. Although it can be customizable, it would be nice to change the default UI of the plugin to something more elegant, while still retaining full functionality and ease of use.3. A better explanation of the options and the use of the KPRPC JSON file: I am not sure what this file does. Sometimes keefox recognizes login details from Keepass and works without storing this entry in keepass string fields. When keefox saves a login/pass info from Firefox to keepass then it always stores this entry.

Join the Greasemonkey users group: http://groups.google.com/group/greasemonkey-users/As one of the devs who helped get rid of the old manager, I felt the old manager to be clunky. The new manager is much more simple and streamlined. It also fits in better with the rest of Firefox. Many people just hate change. Every time Facebook changes its layout millions of people create groups to complain about everything that is wrong with what has changed and how it should just go back to what it was like before. GM has had essentially the same script manager since its inception so it makes sense that many people would hate the new one. If you really don't like the new manager, and are willing to ignore all of the improvements in this and future versions, sure go back and use the old version. No one is forcing you to update. But myself and the other devs are going to work to improve GM not maintain the status quo, so please refrain from making useless negative reviews in protest. Either go to the group I posted above and give us constructive criticism on how we could make the new manager better, or keep using the old version and go back to your cave.The number of people writing reviews to complain about the lack of being able to change the @includes/@excludes is disproportional to the number of people who don't use that functionality often or at all. Most users just install scripts verbatim and don't mess with anything. One tactic I suggest is that you also contact the creator of the script to change the rules for you.You can still changes these rules in the Metadata of the actual script. Just click the edit button in the manager. If you're in Firefox 4, just right click the script. Once you've changed the script, you just refresh the page. The new rules will take into effect. For syntax details see here: http://wiki.greasespot.net/Metadata_Block#.40includeThe result of many scripts(actually I doubt there are many) breaking is due to two factors. One is that we have a weird bug that makes eval stop working. We are currently trying to identify and fix that issue. The second is that these scripts that break are poorly written. There are incredibly few instances where the use of eval is valid.As for incompatibly with All-in-One-Sidebar, we are aware of this and have a ticket open, just as we have tickets open for other issue with 0.9.0: https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/issues/labels/affects-0.9.0"", ""I think you people should be reporting these problems into their forum.
